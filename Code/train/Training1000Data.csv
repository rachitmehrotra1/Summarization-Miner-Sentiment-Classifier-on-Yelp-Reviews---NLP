I remember going there when the packing district was coming alive at 3 and 4 a.m.  We were coming back from a night of being out 'n about with friends (this was in high school/college summers in the mid-70's).  We would order wild concoction in sandwiches with french fries IN them.

I'd heard about all the hype and this place lived up to it.

To have it all piled up into one sando is a midnighter's ""raid the fridge"" dream. A nice combo of pastrami & corned beef, a layer of good cole slaw and topped off with some golden fries makes for one tasty sandwich. Had it been after last call somewhere I'm sure a fried egg on top would have been thrown into the mix.

Couple this with a 23 oz. beer for $2.50 and what more could you ask for.

Always going to the same place yet not really.  Our little group, which inlcuded the parents(yeah i still get free food) went to the Market Square location. The location is nice. Market Square is a nice area. Brick inlaid street. Clsoe to 3 river point park and my hotel.
This restaurant is something one must do when in town. It was also on Food Network, and man times reviewed here at Yelp. The food is pretty good. Where else can you get a ""value meal"" between to slices of bread. The sandwiches for those just learning. Your choice of meat with some nice itailian deli selections, kolbassi(haven't seen that  on a menu i around SF), or fish, below a nice bed of fresh made and not too dripping wet coleslaw. Fries with that? Heck yes and they sit right on top.  All on a Itialian sliced bread. The have a daily beer special 24oz beer for about  $2.50. 
Now this place and the food is fun. The food gets better tasting as the hours get late on a night out. Think how great a bacon wrapped dog is after ""dancing"" the night away. You know that fun 3 step dance. Raise beer, tip glass, put back down. The kind of food and place you want to head when you cheat on your diet, watch some footbal and chat up with the locals.

Add a local Yuengling beer (America's oldest and best brewery) if you like.

If the sandwich is too much for you to handle, take a stroll at the tri-state park.

The place is usually very busy at lunch time, with waitresses hustling around, wearing store T-shirt knotted around the waist, dashing in and out (since they do have outdoor tables).

Ladies and Gents, to comprehend what I am about to lay upon you I feel it's only right that I paint a picture of the womb from whence it came.
 
Welcome to Da Burgh, Ahhrn City --An old east coast city in Southwestern Pennsylvania, situated on the hills and valleys carved out by the Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela.  It rains a good deal here.  The city was built by many Eastern Europeans, some Italian, and some German immigrants who worked their asses off in the steel mills years ago.  Currently, Pittsburgh is much less blue-collar, but it still maintains much of rough blue-collar charm.  People here are genuine, love their football, beer, cigarettes (Marlboros and Camels not Parliament Lights), and facial hair (usually unkempt ones with neck beardage or the cookie duster mustaches often popular with middle-aged men with last names ending in ""ski"".)

Only out of a city such as Pittsburgh, could the Primanti Bros. Sandwich become a legendary food.

A Primanti Bros. Sandwich starts with thick slice of homemade bread, then the usual suspects of meats, cheeses, french fries are put on top, and then sweet & sour slaw is slung on top of that, and finally a tomato, and another piece of thick homemade bread.  The entire creation is plopped down flimsy piece of cooking parchment and shoved across the counter your way.  It's a huge toppling sloppy mess.  The only way to fit the damn thing in your mug is too smash it down before you bite in.  Whatever your modus operandi for eating a Primanti, there just ain't a way to eat it with dignity and still eat it right.

If you're having trouble visualizing this, check out their website. Besides their city menu has the #2 best seller indicated and yet oddly enough absolutely no mention whatsoever of the #1 or #3? primantibrothers.com

The true yinzer sandwich option that I recommend is the Kolbassi and Cheese.  The Kolbassi is split open and dropped into the fryer.  Yes, a deep fried sausage topped with cheese, fries, and slaw.  The grease just glistening from the singed flesh as it absorbs into the thick white bread (dignity is overrated anyway). Make sure yinz warsh it dahn wit ah cold ahhrn city, en'at.  (translation: Make sure you wash it down with a cold Iron City Beer and that.)

Primanti Bros. is definitely not diet food, but most definitely a 100% genuine Pittsburgh food.  It is disgusting in all the right ways.

Take two slices of Italian Bread, between them, mash together bland cole slaw, fries, some assorted meat, tomatoes. And at your fingertips is Pitt's pride and joy.  I'm not from here, so maybe I don't share the love. We weren't really drunk when we were eating here, and it was in the middle of the day. 

The service was pretty slow, but when our order was taken, the sandwich came out very fast.

It was a good sandwich in terms of having really hot meat, and cold tomatoes and cole slaw, but I didn't think its as tasty as it could have been.

I think the bread should be buttered and toasted/grilled texas toast, and they should use seasoned fries. Use some sweet North Carolina style Cole slaw.

I probably won't be back ever again.",NegativeR4-UPl8ZHvDfCeIg5dN2EQ,"One night I was watching the Travel channel, they had a show called Top 10 Places to Pig Out.  Of course I paying attention and taking notes :)  When they mentioned Primanti's and Pittsburgh I was like Yes! I'm there!  I could not wait to get my hands on this giant sammich of all sammiches.  My only regret is that I couldn't get it with a Yeungling :( All the more reason to come back!  Ok, so I went here with my host and we decided to strategize.  I got the capicola ham with provolone and he got the steak and cheese.  We got two sammiches and two cokes for $16, what a deal! We were supposed to share but ended up downing our own sammiches. I forgot to ask if the coleslaw was sweet before I ordered so I was a little worried, not a fan of sweet coleslaw.  Luckily, it was great! 
Here's the nitty gritty.  The sandwich bread is two thick slices of soft, white italian bread.  They put at least half a pound of meat on it, plenty of cheese, tomatoes, and a fresh coleslaw (not the mayonaissey type that I was expecting).  It's more like a marinated shredded cabbage, the marinade is tangy and vinegary.  The piece de resistance is that the sandwich also contains a huge mound of fries right in the middle.  The fries taste fresh, reminiscent of boardwalk fries back in the day, only better.  At the table they had ketchup, mustard and apple cider vinegar!  Any one from MD would appreciate that ;-)  All I needed was Old Bay seasoning and it woulda been heaven.  Maybe next time I'll take that in my purse...ssshh! Needless to say I devoured this bad boy and desperately needed a nap afterwards.    I came. I saw. I ate.

They put everything on. Fries, meat, slaw, all together between two pieces of bread. Definitely worth the experience for a non Pittsburgh person. 

Upside: Quick prep of food. If you want a semi fast food place where you sit down and actually take time to eat, you can order and eat and be out relatively quick. Prices are great!

Having said that, while the inclusion of an enormous amount of fries and coleslaw on the sandwich was great, the tiny piece of beef ""patty"" that can only be described as something they use as a weight watchers/jenny craig portion leaves much to be desired. I honestly felt like I was eating some sort of vegetarian sandwich with a tiny piece of shriveled up beef patty lost somewhere in between the enormous slices of Italian bread.

Two of us had the turkey and one had the colossal fish.  I thought the turkey was slimy and tasted weird.  The fries added almost no flavor to the sandwich, and the cole slaw was gross.

As much a Pittsburgh institution as the Stillers, Irn City, and Sophie Masloff.  Much like referring to Kleenex, to native yinzers, you just go and get a Primanti's.  No need for any further descriptives.  

The secret to the sandwich is the bread: thickly sliced Mancini's bread.  Rumor has it that Primanti's opened a location in Florida.  It didn't do very well because they weren't able to get the Mancini's.  There you go.  My favorite version of the Primanti's is the steak and cheese.  It's a beef patty and cheese (not sliced beef as in a cheese steak).  This is the only thing I will eat tabasco on.  Fresh, thick cut fries and mild vinegar based cole slaw.  Piled up perfection.

I was expecting a mayo based coleslaw, but it's vinegar based (which was better and better for you). Like others have said, the meat quantity is so small that it's a sidekick to the coleslaw and fries. I really liked the overall flavor. I just wished the meat, slaw, and fries were more in proportion to one another. (again, see picture).

Again, as mentioned, the slaw is NOT mayo-ey which is great for me (I hate mayo) The prices are great, I believe my sandwich was $5.99. I also got a 23oz yuengling for $3. To be completely honest, the food is not especially great, but its the novelty and uniqueness that makes me give it such a high rating. Don't get me wrong, it's a good sandwich, but just pretty standard.

**On the menu, the cheesesteak says #2 most requested, so when our waiter came over I asked what the number one most requested was, and he said ""beer"". I know its a line, but still so funny.

Yes, this was a huge sandwich with fries and cole slaw in it, but the sheer quantity of food didn't make up for the fact that it was really bland.

Looking up at the menu I was a bit dissapointed to see no ""cheesesteak"" but they did have the Pitts-Burgher Steak (our #2 top seller).  I ordered, and the gentleman next to me said the sandwich was good, he was from Illinois and said that he had seen the place on Diners Drive Ins and Dives.  That amped up my expectations a bit.  

The waitress who was friendly mentioned that the sandwich was a mess, but that was a good thing.  But speaking of messes, the grill and fryers were filthy, but then again what else should I expect.

My sandwich arrived and it was an impressive quantity of food and utterly unique meal between bread.  There is a rectangular patty, provelone cheese, fries topped by slaw between two slices of italian bread.  The bread was great, but the rest of the sandwich was short on flavor.  The patty was just kinda a brown mass, and the fries and slaw topping the patty were just kinda there.  I found myself adding malt vinnegar to the slaw and eventually dipping in ketchup to add  some flavor.

I got out for $10, tip included.  For good price, good quantity of food, and friendly staff I give this place 3 stars, but no more because the flavor isn't there",ObjectiveSAd4mBQy7ot-0_6KL4qt_A,"I found myself in Pittsburgh one Sunday morning while pursuing the baseball parks of America, and a little bit of preemptive research made it unavoidable to visit Pittsburgh and NOT have a Primanti Bros. sandwich.

When I arrived into the city, I parked my car and made my way to Market Square location, where I was told that it was also where a few scenes of She's Out of My League was filmed, (which by the way, I enjoyed that movie since it so closely hit home to a dork like me), but upon arrival, I was mortified to see nothing but construction equipment and chain link fences.

But anyway, I go into Primanti's, and I'm bombarded by Pittsburgh sports - this does not bother me, but the sheer magnitude was a bit unexpected.  The wall of Clemente, Steel Curtain photos, and my personal favorite, the shoe-string tackle of Nick Harper, which I find amusing to be considered one of the greatest plays in Pittsburgh sports apparently.  The rest of the establishment is clean and well-traveled appearing, and lots of high-def televisions satiates the sports-lover's attention whilst waiting on food.

So being the tourist that I am, I don't really know what to get, so I ask the waitress of ""what is THE food for a tourist like me?""  With a confident smirk, she simply says ""pastrami,"" and I thank her for the suggestion, and I realize that it wasn't so much ""a suggestion"" as it was ""the order,"" and five minutes later, this monstrosity on a baking sheet is presented to me.  Thin-sliced pastrami, cole slaw, tomato, and I think there was some cheese in there, but a fistful of fries as well - you guys know the drill.

So in conclusion, great success.  I thought the pastrami sandwich was the stuff of legend, and just thinking about it has me kind of craving one again, even after lunch.  In fact, the best part of this particular trip to Pittsburgh was Primanti Bros., because my Braves ended up sending out the D-team, who naturally failed to beat a mediocre Pirates squad.

The coleslaw was OK, but the french fries were awful, and the little bit of actual meat had little taste. We had little to no contact with employees, but a cab driver told us about a young couple who dared to ask for a sandwich at another Primanti Bros without coleslaw, and were treated really rudely.

And well: Primanti Bros is better. It was delicious. I had the pastrami and it was wonderful and had nice crispy edges from being fried on the grill. The bread was soft and easy to bite through and the coleslaw was perfection. Coleslaw is my least favorite, unless it's vinegar based and this was vinegar based. It wasn't too vinegar-y and I could tell there was a little something sweet in it. All in all, it paired well with the rest of the sandwich. The fries were crisp and not at all soggy as well. It was marvelous and I could've eaten another one.

Except that I had two huge yuenglings because I was in pennsylvania. you can't get it here, ok?

I tried really hard to be blown away by the experience but in the end it was just ""A-OK"" for me. Nothing really special about it. 

First, our server was horrible and I have hard time with poor customer service. Trust me, I'm not a guy with ridiculous expectations either, I rarely (if ever) complain to a manager, etc.. Anyway, she was really preoccupied with this group of young guys who were drinking a few beers and giving her some attention. To say she was train wreck would be an understatement so I'm sure it felt good to have a couple of buzzed construction workers flirting with her BUT I don't want to suffer over her self-indulgence. Just saying. 

We both ordered the pastrami sandwich and it came out rather quickly. The bread, which is made fresh daily was amazing; it literally melted in your mouth. The pastrami was just ""ehhh, ok."" It was lean but it didn't seem to pack a real punch from a flavor standpoint. I prefer mine I little more charred up with some seasoning. I could probably go with out having the fries on my actually sandwich as well. Apparently, that's there big move; they put the fries and cole slaw on your sandwich. I was also a little bummed about the fries; they end up getting really greasy and soggy. I'm a fries ""well-done"" kind of guy so this didn't really impress me from a flavor or texture standpoint. In the end, it didn't add to the flavor of the sandwich for me; it actually made it a big soggy mess.

The portions are enormous and the price is right for lunch. Well under what I think they could charge for the amount of food they give you. 

For those Pittsburgh-ians who travel to the Los Angeles area, let me recommend Langers (look it up). The place is a landmark in Los Angeles and their pastrami and corned beef is absolutely second-to-none. In a fight, it would smoke Primanit Bros. like cheap crack. Just my two cents.

After eating a Pittsburgher (the second most popular dish) and trying the colossal fish sandwich, and a capicola sandwich, I've decided that the best part of my meal was the IC light. 

My friend's colossal fish was the best of the three and it's best eaten as two meals. My Pittsburgher was the pitts and I wouldn't order it again. Unlike your pitts on a 90+ degree day, it was really dry. The sandwich was only salvaged by my grotesque use of hot sauce. The concept isn't that ridiculous either. Just get fries and coleslaw and put it in your sandwich. The chili cheese fries were mediocre as well, but the portion again was hugemongous.

I'd come back here if I were in Pittsburgh again because its just a nice place to chill at on Market Square. But the food is only serviceable. Substituting quantity with quality can only get you so far.

I would say yes, you should try it if you happen to come to Pittsburgh, but try not to expect a lot because that might have killed the sandwich for me.

The sandwich is packed with great meat, but the fries were pretty soggy and coleslaw that day was a bit too much pepper for my liking. I thought the fries might have been soggy because of the coleslaw so I ordered another order of fries (since I'm generally a fries fiend), but even those were soft and not up to par.

Chillax, I'm not horny; a 3 way is a Cinci ""delicacy"" featuring spaghetti topped with a very thin chili and cheese. Calm down children.

Anywhoo, whilst making this visit to Pittsburgh, I told my padre it was absolutely necessary we eat here. Why? I've seen Adam Richman, Guy Fieri and every other chubby traveling food dude drool over these. I wanted one. Bad.

When you walk in, it's a dive, for sure. Seat yourself, everyone's in sweats, eatin a big hunk o' meat stuffed with french fries and coleslaw.

An Ohio girl can get used to this.

At the (also very chillax) waitress's recommendation I took Cappacola, which apparently is a Pittsburgh tradition. My dad took the Tuna Fish, and we waited...ten minutes. My food is here. And it looks AWESOME. My first bite was, orgasmic. Yes, orgasmic. This sandwich turns me on.

Sorry 3 way.

But this...sandwich...is...amazzzzzzzzzzzing! It's spicy, it's crunchy, it's sweet, it's salty, it's...hey there's bread too! ALL IN ONE. My dad also enjoyed his sandwich, at least I think he did. I'm not quite sure. I was into this love affair way too much. If this were considered cheating on a boyfriend, I would cheat. Every week. Maybe everyday, depending on how often I can get to this sandwich.

I love this sandwich. You will too. You will also be full. Oh so very full. You will have coleslaw coming off your chin and french fries overflowing your basket after you're done.

Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. 

Think a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.

First, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. 

My dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The ""bacon"" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries.

Like Deep Dish pizza in Chicago or bagels in New York. You just gotta, ok? Locals seem to be split on whether its worth it...so, saddle on up to give it a shot yourself. 

Sitting outside on Market Square in the sunshine (and with Batman filming in the near distance!), we embarked on my first Primanti experience.

Half the sandwich falls out while your eating.  The ""cheesesteak"" might be the most tasteless sandwich ever.  You have to use a whole bottle of hot sauce just to get a little flavor.

I opted for the Colossal fish and cheese sandwich (6.99).  The fish had a nice crisp batter, the fires were a bit soggy , the bread was nice and soft and the slaw was decent.  Alone I loved the fish, All together the starch of the bread and fried over power the fish. There was hot sauce at the table to help add flavor (frank's red hot style). 

Seating is odd, seat your self and you will get service when you are noticed. Drink come in to go cups and the menu is on paper for you to keep as notice to you doctor of your  1000+ calorie meal.

I sat at the bar and ordered the pastrami sandwich with the provolone, slaw, fries and tomato. The slaw was exactly how I like it; vinegar instead of mayo is the way to go. The fries were pretty good but not amazing. Not sure if they double-fry the fries but they needed to be a bit crispier in my opinion, especially when you consider that they will get automatically soggy on the sandwich.

Yes, the place is small, it is in Market Square, and will remain there, wouldn't you be disappointed if one day you wanted Primanti's and no more Market Square location?  I know I would.  If I were in the downtown region and had that craving I wouldn't want to have to work my way up to the Strip just for a bite of that Pittsburgh goodness.  

The 'it's a Pittsburgh' thing comments baffle me.  If you have food shows featuring the sandwich, magazines writing about it, and it's considered the 'Manliest Restaurant in America,'  I think that means it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.  Why else would Primanti's be featured on such media?  Why else would these people centered around shows and magazines venture to a Primanti's?  I mean that has to show you it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.

And 'it's so greasy?'  Did you not watch them makes your sandwich, which you picked from their extensive menu, on the griddle in front of you?  Expect it to be greasy, they are frying it for you and melting that cheese on it.  Maybe don't even pay attention to the greasy factor, especially with that crunchy coleslaw and heap of fries placed between those two thick slices of Italian bread.

We ordered the Kolbassi & Cheese and the Pitts-burger cheesesteak (#2 best seller).  I had half of each one along with cheese fries.  I thought both sandwiches were a little dry especially the cheesesteak.  The coleslaw seemed to be too dry for my taste or maybe it was the abundance of fries that dried everything out for me.  I am not a big fry fan in the first place.  I would like to see some other options for bread like a wheat or whole grain option.  I would also recommend putting extra cheese on the sandwich as I couldn't even taste cheese.  I like cheese and they need more to help balance the dryness.

Service was a little lame as I barely could understand our ""too cool"" server.  He seemed disinterested in us for the most part.  The pregnant waitress who helped us out once seemed more congenial and helpful.  I like the fact that it is small and fast.  I just don't get the vast appeal.

If you've never sat by the grill, you should, just to see them in action.  On a busy lunch day, it's not uncommon for them to have 15 things going at once, and they keep track of what's what via...broken french fries.  I've never seen or heard them get anything wrong, either!  While I wouldn't call them chefs, as the menu at the end of the day is simple, they definitely have a solid skill set at the griddle.

If you've never been to Primaniti's, here are a few tips from a seasoned veteran.  
Tip 1:  Always get fried egg.  Always.  On everything.  
Tip 2:  Pick up a bottle of hot sauce and sploosh it on the fries...those of you complaining about bland fries definitely need to try the hot sauce technique, as it makes a definite difference.  
Tip 3: The ""cheesesteak"" sucks and is a travesty that people are encouraged to order this abomination, as compared to many other items of deliciousness on the menu. 
Tip 4: I'm a  big fan of capicola (with egg) and the colossal fish.  The fish is huge, and you will feel like a fat kid if you finish it.  
Tip 5: A 23oz  ""Iron"" is only like $4.  Get one and talk like a Yinzer for a complete experience.

What more could you really ask for from a sandwich joint?",Objectivelyz21pKHqlUCGSzjkzaFFw,"Before Food Network started showing a bajillion shows about sandwiches with french fries, fried eggs, cheese sticks, the kitchen sink  and other stuff piled on top of them, there weren't that many restaurants doing it. Now you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a restaurant that is piling anything on top of a sandwich to try to stand out.

Primanti's, however, isn't some new fad. They have been putting fries and cole slaw on their sandwiches for roughly 745 years (Note: that may be slightly innacurate, but the point is, they've been around a while). This started as a way for the blue collar workers of Pittsburgh to be able to carry their whole lunch in one hand, to eat on th go... and a great idea was born. Adding a fried egg to any sandwich is an option, and it is also almost always a good idea - and should be mandatory if you order the cappicola and cheese. 

Primanti's has a lot of locations now, pretty much all around the Pittsburgh area, but unlike most chains, they seem to have suffered no growing pains from expansion, and every restaurant seems to be top notch and consistent in food quality. The regular sandwiches are big, but if you want to grow your waistline a couple inches in one sandwich, get the colossal fish. It is ridiculously large, and the fish is great. If you're feeling a little adventurous and have never had a real sardine before, try the sardine sandwich. These aren't those slimy little jarred bait fish you get in grocery stores. They are nice sized real sardines - a little oily, just enough briny sea flavor, and being Primanti's, you get plenty of them.

First off, what's up with Pittsburgh and ginger ale?  I've never heard of any place serving ginger ale in a cup, bottle or can in Texas, but here it seems to be everywhere!  Every place we stopped to eat and even a few bars recommended I try their ginger ale and it's really good!  So we all got that to drink.  

To start we tried the chili since it was posted on the wall as great chili.  A few friends told me ""don't get the chili, you're there for a sandwich.""  They were right.  The chili wasn't good.  We don't put beans in chili here, and it should be thick, meaty, and able to eat through a spoon.  This stuff was weak, watery and full of beans and maybe some other vegetables.  Our chili would make people in Pittsburgh fall over dead.

I got a double sweet and hot sausage sandwich, the wife had the Philly, and the kids had corned beef and a ham.

The real novelty at Primanti Brothers is that all of there sandwiches include french fries and cole slaw inside that sandwich. And to that I say... ""who cares"".  I personally didn't care for the fries and slaw inside my sandwich, but I am also not a huge french fry or cole slaw fan. (I like the good ones, but I can easily pass on average,) I will say that their cole slaw, which was vinegar rather than mayonnaise based, was quite good. And there fries were above average, but not as good as somewhere like say, Five Guys. 

The ingredients in the sandwich were all pretty good. I had the Pastrami and my friend had the Angus steak. The bread, meat, cheese, etc., were all good quality and were distinct when tasted individually. The sandwiches also seemed to work OK as a package, but for some reason for me--aside from the novelty factor--they didn't stand out. I think that maybe with the fries and slaw in there, there is just too much going on and those two tend to dominate the whole sandwich. It really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients.

And when I mean ridiculous, I mean tradition diner style, huge white bread, large grease meat topped with coleslaw and FRENCH FRIES. Yes, each sandwich is finished with fries. The place is classic and charming and goofy and a heart attack just smelling the fumes - but it's fun and unique and the food is quite good if you can avoid thinking about the health affects.

While it may be overrated for being featured on the food network, it is a pretty good sandwich place (no not just because the portions...while they are generous)

The colossal fish sandwich is pretty good. The cheese steak is not a cheese steak!

If you are a college student, you should eat here at least 1X per month, if not more.",ObjectiverFdds2TYHv26GEsI7t87gw,"Well, it finally happened: I had to give a place a single star. And it kills me that the place I gave it to had to be Primanti's. I'm an awful Pittsburgher.

I don't give low ratings easily or often, so believe me: this place pushed all of my buttons to earn this awful review. In fact, the single star was only earned because the place is cleaner and more comfy than some of the other Primanti places I've been too. It kind of has an old diner feeling to it and I liked that. 

Alas, that's all I liked.

So, why such a low score? Well:

The service was terrible. After spending twenty minutes sitting without anyone coming to refill my water or ask for my actual order - note, the place was almost completely empty - I went to the register to ask for something to eat, which I'd started to think I had to do after watching a couple people do the same (in hindsight, I probably misinterpreted their actions, but my mistake does not excuse what happened next). My waiter looked at me and went, ""Don't you get the concept of a restaurant? Haven't you been to any restaurants, like, ever? Sit back down and I'll take your order."" 

And not even in a joking manner that made me feel like I could smile about my mistake - this guy was being a condescending, rude, arrogant person. It was unbelievable. Utterly, totally unbelievable. If I hadn't met company there that night, I would have walked out right then.

To make matters worse, this was not a good night to order anything at Primanti's. The coleslaw was way too sweet and there was far too much of it, the fries were bland and had no texture at all, and there was barely any meat on my sandwich at all. The result? A big pile of carbs that really didn't taste great after the first few bites, rather than a delicious sandwich.

Before you all kill me, please note: I LIKED my meal at Mt. Lebanon's Primanti location. They also have a more diverse menu, which is always a bonus for me - I like having more options. I think in the future, I will stick to that location in this local chain, where even on a busy night I managed to get food in a decent amount of time. I certainly will not be coming to the downtown location if I spot my previous, downright awful waiter working there again.",Negative5rEjMXLuLmCm0raaqKWn7A,"Had to visit the ""Famous"" Primanti Brother's Bar and Grill during my first visit to Pittsburgh, but most likely will only go back if my friends/family really  want to eat there.

Food:  The portions are huge, not very greasy, served nice and hot but over all very bland.  I got the Colossal Fish and Cheese sandwich.  The beer batter fish was a very large piece and by itself was not bad tasting at all (just a little under seasoned.)  The fries were limp and had no seasoning what so ever. The fries were the worse part of the sandwich.  The coleslaw was  very mild, sweet and vinegar base, and by itself it was ok, but put everything together between two slices of white bread and it made for a bland pile of flavorless starch.  The bread was also too soft and did not hold up well at all, and the cheese was nonexistent.  I ended up having to add a ton of salt, pepper and malt vinegar to my sandwich, picked it apart and ate the pieces with my fingers.

Price:  For the size of the portions you get, the price is great!  I got two sandwiches and a soda for about $16.  Their sandwiches range from around $6 - $8 each, and are a good value since you will definitely leave full (I took home left overs.)

Atmosphere:  After reading a few reviews about the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this place was not packed with tourist.  For being such a small dinner, the place was fairly empty so I was able to sit anywhere I liked (being a solo traveler, restaurants often try to stick me at the bar but I prefer to sit at a table.)  The tables were clean and organized well, and each table had a stack of paper menus to look at.  It felt like a comfy, good ol' local dinner where you can casually relax and eat.

Staff:  During my visit, the staff was great!  There was only one waitress and one cook, but both were pleasant and greeted me as soon as I walked in.  The waitress was attentive and friendly.  The cook also thanked me for patronizing there while I was leaving.

Over all, I basically came here just to say that I visited a famous Pittsburgh restaurant, but I most likely will not go there again.  If I was with friends or family who wanted to go to Primanti's I would go along, but I wouldn't go solo.  The blandness of the food is what kills it for me.  I would rather get a sandwich that is half the size with more flavor, then a huge pile of bland food.",ObjectivehpZ9oLCaqT2ro44QJqldHg,"I heard good things..after all Primanti Brothers have developed a nice chain in the area.

I think this is more of an acquired taste kind of place.  Not that I wouldn't go back, it's okay for an occasional visit.  There are other sandwiches to try.  But if you're used to the true pastrami with Swiss on rye, I wouldn't recommend the sandwich here.

My husband ordered the Italian Sausage, which was obscenely big, with good flavor, but again the fries were mush and flavorless. Luckily, we had ordered an additional side of slaw, because that's truly what made the sandwich, which was very tasty. We also ordered the ""vegetarian"" soup which was good, but I ordered a chix salad because a MASSIVE sandwich with fries and slaw on it was just not calling me. Little did I know, the gimmick of fries on everything meant fries on everything....including my salad. It was really gross to have these tasteless grease piles on my salad which I couldn't even eat.

No one in our party had their preferences honored (no fries, cole slaw on the side, etc.)  We were a little disappointed in the service.

It was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries.  

The thick white bread was dry and boring; too crusty. 

The fries on the sandwich overpowered the taste! So I dismantled it. When the rude server asked how I liked it, I was honest. He gave me big time attitude and commented that I took it apart. I told him, I took it apart because it was a horrible sandwich (the pastrami, by the way). And that, sir, is why you got a $0.35 tip!

If you have to put all that hot sauce on the sandwich to make it palatable, why bother?  (The server, as he walked away, told me it's really good with hot sauce, which was just Tabasco, which I don't like, any way!)

They left off the tomato that supposedly comes with each sandwich!

I would recommend this place for visitors from afar and who happens to be in the neighborhood.",Positivek71-13VoU1Moejb2C6d2jg,"I had lived outside of Pittsburgh for a couple of years and have eaten at this Primanti Brothers location four or five times. Their sandwiches were always tasty, worth the wait and the trouble of finding parking etc. So, when my parents came to visit, and we made a trip out that-a-way, I knew that would be a lunch stop. We ended up coming into Pittsburgh on Sunday around 1pm. I knew it would be crowded and anticipated having a wait. We got a table after 15 to 20 minutes and quickly sat down before someone else did. It took the waitress about 10 minutes to come and clear the previous customers remnants, which was ok. 

We ordered our beers and were told that she'd come back and take our order. She came back 20 minutes later, with the beers and took our order. After that, we sat around and waited for our sandwiches for 35 minutes. When we did finally get our food, it was ice cold. The fries in the sandwich were completely soggy and cold, and the meat was barely warm. Our table ran out of napkins, and we asked for some, but they never came, finally, the table next to ours handed us a few. Maybe it was because it was cold, but the sandwiches weren't that great. I had very little meat in mine, and more coleslaw that anything else. Also, the thickness of the bread seems to have increased since I last ate here because about 60% of my sandwich was bread. We were fairly disgruntled about the whole thing, but were still going to leave a tip for the waitress. 

Then, my dad went to the bar to pay. He stood there for 10 minutes, behind another customer. The server came up to them and said 'what the hell are you doing up here?', in those words!! My dad was so stunned be just stood there, the guy in line ahead of him told her that he was waiting to pay his bill, so she cashed him out and then turned around to do something else, when my dad said 'excuse me, i need to pay too', she replied to him ' Jeez, you guys are so demanding! Why the hell are you in such a hurry"". That is when their tip went straight out the door with us. 

We were ok waiting for a table, we were even ok waiting for our food; it took them one hour from the time we sat down, to the time we got our food, and then the server had the audacity to behave in that manner. Either Primanti Brothers has become too big for their boots and let things slide, or they need to train their staff to be more polite and efficient.

Our server was quick and efficient and we never were in need of refills or anything else.

I got the Pitts-burgher cheese steak and we tried an order of the Smallman Street Fries.  The fries were truly loaded.  The chili had a nice kick to it and there was literally an ice cream scoop of sour cream on top.  However, the fries were actually seasoned that well and were under done in my opinion.  That didn't bode well for the fries on the sandwich, but I kept my hopes high.

The sandwich comes out and its a monster.  I love the italian bread, the beef patty and cheese, the slaw was good (shredded cabbage, not like southern cole slaw).  Everything was fresh but, again, the fries were the worst part.  Underdone, underseasoned.  Definitely my least favorite part.

Most times, when out of towners ask for a local spot to eat, I'm one of the few that actually pushes them AWAY from this defacto Burgh tradition.  Don't get me wrong, Primanti's isn't bad, but it isn't exactly great either.  Typically I end up smothering mine in hot sauce and salt/pepper to get some flavor onto otherwise bland sandwiches.

With that said, every once in awhile, I get this odd, insatiable craving for a cap and egg sandwich (w/ onion)... and when I do cave to that temptation, it's oddly satisfying.

On the experience front, Primanti's is definitely one of a kind.  I don't know of anywhere else you can get burly bartenders to slam down a mess of a sandwich in wax paper on your table (something the suburban restaurants fail to provide).

When I'm in the mood for them, they are fantastic. So when my mother and aunt came to visit da Burgh for the first time they were intensely curious about local restaurants, and this one came up. They thought it sounded fun and different, but since one is pescatarian leaning to the veg side, and the other is gluten intolerant, I really didn't think Primanti would be the best place to take them.

Walking around down town we passed this one, and they wanted to sit down and give it a try. It was a beautiful day so we sat outside, which was really amazing. We were also amazed by our server. By the end of the meal, we were amazed she remembered to show up at work at all. In fact, its a distinct possiblility that she didn't ever work there, and was just confused and thought she was at the greek place across the square. You don't go to a sandwich shop to be blown away by your server, but there is a minimum standard you should aspire to, and she was far off that mark.

She took forever to get there, but it was no hardship sitting outside on a beautiful day with two of my favorite gals. We talked about the menu, Auntie decided to order anything with no bread, with some loaded fries. Mom wanted a sardine sandwich, but only if its the sardine filets, she doesn't like the kind with bones. She is not one to make a fuss, so figured cheese and egg would be fine too. 

When she came around for drinks, they got a water and a pop. I asked if she had PBR, and she replied she didn't know. Then continued to stand there, pen in hand, ready to write my drink order down. OK then, how about I just have a diet pop. Before she ran off, we ordered our meals. I asked her if the sardines have bones in them or not. She looked up from her note pad and looked at me with a look that said {insert foul insult here} and shrugged. A big, slow, deliberate shrug. Not a word. And then just stood there waiting to write my order down. After a good, long, awkward pause, she said ""I don't know.""  All three of us just looked back at her, waiting, until eventually she sighed, held her pad down by her side, and with a big roll of the eyes, asked if I wanted her to check. Yes. Please do.

So then she ran off, and started running food out to tables all around and refilling drinks. Running the sandwiches, she would grab two or three tables at a time, and then put all the sandwiches down, sort of paw through them to see what was what, and leave theirs and take the rest. It was just strange.

She came back, and without looking up announced ""Don't matter, we are out of sardines anyways.""Facepalm! From the length of time she had been inside the restaurant, I doubt she even asked. Mom, very uncomfortable that her question had become such a horrible inconvenience, asked for egg and cheese. Auntie ordered loaded fries to start, then her corned beef with no bread. The waitress told her she already gets fries with her sandwich, but she wanted them anyways. I got balogna, just because neither of them would ever guess what jumbo means.

Of course, the order came out quickly, and wrong. Mine was fine the way it came, but not what I asked for. Mom was the same. Auntie was fine, but no loaded fries every showed up. Until we got the check, that's where they were. Getting those taken off was another huge inconvenience to our poor server.

Sounds interesting but the coleslaw was slightly bitter and I'm used to coleslaw being a little sweet. Too many fries on the sandwich.

The bread was bulky but soft and held up nicely to the last bite.  The slaw that they used was great and like nothing I've had before.  It was vinegar based but not too strong.

It's just bad. The servers are polite, but extremely inattentive. I'm going to go ahead and play my ""I Waited on Tables in High Volume Restaurants for Several Years"" card just so I can say that even during lunch rush, no, that level of absence is not acceptable. They take up to fifteen minutes to even greet the table, which leaves you looking around wondering who will be serving you, or if you can at least have a water. If I were serving, I'd at least pop over and say a quick, ""Hi, my name's Ali. I'll be with you in just a few minutes."" No matter how busy you are, there are a few things you just don't let slip: greetings, drink refills, and a speedy check. If it's busy, communicate that delay by saying ""thank you for waiting,"" or ""sorry for the wait."" Honestly that's all it takes. That's it! Primanti's servers were lacking in all of these things, and from the customer perspective, it really does make a difference in the experience.

And I've traveled to the north, south, east, and west of this great country.  So, I've been around the food block to know a good sandwich when I see one... and the sandwiches here are off da hook!  It's probably unlike any other sandwich you've ever had (unless you're a Pittsburgher, duhhh).  Who puts French fries on a sandwich?  And piles on the sweet and sour cole slaw?  On soft, thick sliced French bread?  Primanti Bros does!  

I was in town for work, and of course had to catch a Penguins game...  and was glad to see how close this place was to the arena!  My co-worker and I came here afterward and were majorly impressed.  The corned beef one is sooooo good.  I seriously was sad when it was finished, haha.  I'm sure it's not super healthy, but it didn't feel unhealthy either.  It wasn't greasy, there weren't too many fries on it (a good thing, it was balanced well with probably 8-10 fries on top), the slaw was fresh and crisp, and the corned beef wasn't too greasy at all.  That soft French bread is the perfect surrounding for it all.  

The place itself is cool.  It has a nice patio facing the Square, and the inside has a cool diner feel to it.  Service was great and quick, parking was easy... but probably because it was late on a weeknight.  Metered parking, but it was free at that hour. :)  There aren't that many spots on the street, so during the daytime lunch rush or weekend I heard that there is a parking structure nearby.  Oh and prices?  Very reasonable for the amount of food you get.  One sandwich is around $7-8.  I think my sandwich had around 8 slices of corned beef, so that's a great deal.

I ordered smoked pork chops, home fries and green beans. My Mom order salmon cakes, collard greens and mac-cheese. The pork chops had a good smoke flavor, but they were too salty and paper thin. The fries were over-cooked and soft. The green beans were greasy and tasted sweet. Sometimes, people will add a little sugar to green beans if they accidentally add too much salt; I believe that was the case.

My Mom's salmon cakes were dry, the collard greens were flavorless and under cooked (probably just stir-fried) and the mac-cheese was dry.

Not only was the food bad, but it wasn't even hot and my green beans had a little solid grease on them (eeewwwww!).

But, whenever I head back to Charlotte, I make it a point to hit up Mert's at least once, if not three times. 

I usually get the fried catfish with mashed potatoes and collard greens. The catfish is fried to perfection, nice and crisp without being overly oily or heavy, and the cooks make sure to leave the fins and tail on for those customers that really know how to eat fish. The mashed are made from real potatoes, and the collards are very flavorful, kissed with just the right amount of vinegar. And of course, I always gotta have a loaf or two of the absolute best cornbread in the world. There's a reason why the above is listed as my last meal on earth, and given the portions, I may just be able to delay that inevitable end by a good half hour. The portions are HUGE!

There's nothing on the menu I wouldn't try. There are some definite ""safe"" items, especially for breakfast.

I was also able to sample the BBQ pork... It was a tad weird.  My girlfriend accurately pointed out it tasted like curry.   I would steer clear of that.

Also, don't eat Mert's before a day of outdoor activities or extensive traveling, the heavy nature of the food makes it most conducive to a sedentary timeframe (or overall lifestyle).

When we were there, they were out of a myriad of items (OJ, country ham, other breakfast staples), but they more than made up for it with smiles and service.

The food was delivered to me at my table very very very very very hot.  I was unable to comfortably eat for approx. 7 to 10 minutes.   I ordered Fried Chicken, Greens, Yams, Catfish, and Banana Pudding.  The previous day, my business colleague order and ate the red beans and rice.

Service was good.  The menu needs help.

1) The Fried Chicken wasn't really fried.  It looked like baked chicken that was dried out.  Not crispy looking, not seasoned. Not very tasty.
2) The Catfish was a complete fish with bones.  The taste was pretty good! However, I would have enjoyed it more had I not had to de-bone every bite.
3) The Greens were good!
4) Yams were good!
5) Corn bread was just ok

DELICIOUS corn bread. (Seriously, the stuff melts in your mouth...amazing). I got the blackened salmon with okra & tomatoes and collard greens as the sides, sweet tea (the only way tea should be, IMO) and a Blue Moon.

I was excited when it did come out though. The pork had the most wonderful flavor ever. It was drenched in the yummy sauce that they use which was sweet yet spicy. Perfect.

We first walked through the door  and the hostess was so friendly and pleasant.  I guess she was the poster child for ""Southern Hospitality."" The place is warm and looks fairly new, but there are pictures all over the wall of different types of people and autographed posters of actors/actresses from Broadway plays from over the years. 

We ate around 11AM on Saturday, breakfast was still available, as well as lunch items. I opted for lunch items because it had catfish and I am a sucker for catfish from soul food restaurants.  My boyfriend got a breakfast platter and my other friends got fried chicken and salmon cakes.  The catfish was seasoned to perfection.  If it wasn't for the fact that they give you the entire fish, including the tail and bones, I would have ate every single piece of that fish.  However, the fish did fall off the bone easily, but its a mental thing for me.  I did receive mac n cheese with it, which was good as well.  The salmon cakes were good as well.  I did not taste the large portions of fried chicken, but my friend did say it was very good.  Didn't taste the breakfast either, but the plate was squeaky clean after 5 minutes.

They have desserts, but we were so full by the time we ate half of our meals that we couldn't even fathom another bite.  But I would love to go there to have their banana pudding or lemon cake again.

Can't wait to come back to Charlotte for vacation.",PositiveFjurp3SgITn_RUJGHE5Wdg,"Traveling on business I was feeling antsy in the hotel room and decided to get out and explore downtown Charlotte last night. I read on a Chowhound article that Mert's was a good place for a solo diner to get some good local food without feeling weird for eating alone, plus it was Southern Soul Food. The experience started off on a high note with quick, friendly service producing a Carolina Blonde Beer (not local, btw, from Wilkes-Barre, PA) and the pinnacle of the experience: cornbread. The rest of the meal (my shrimp and grits) didn't live up to the hype and so I have to give this place an overall mediocre review.

Pros
-Cornbread- this stuff is the truth. But I felt it set the bar high as my first  taste of Mert's capabilities. Thus while satisfying enormously with its crumbly sweet goodness and soft buttery mouth feel, it paradoxically set the table for disappointment.
-Good Service and Atmosphere - again I was a solo diner and it didn't feel awkward at all. The place is casual, upbeat and friendly. Good for dropping in alone and unannounced.

Cons
-Salad - the 'garden salad' is billed on the menu as a $2 add-on to your entree. I make a point of regular ruffage while traveling, so I took the bait. What I got was literally a bread plate with about an inch-deep layer of iceberg lettuce, a single slice of cucumber and a plastic cup of ranch dressing. I ordered honey mustard. This was about as 'gardeny' as a plastic-wrapped airplane salad and way too much money for what I got. I usually won't mind paying upwards of $10 for a properly vegetated salad, but for $2 this was wickedly overpriced considering an entire head of this lettuce costs about $1 retail. 
-Shrimp and Grits - just ok, bordering on the meh. I wanted to like this so badly, to have the Soul Food experience I've been dreaming of. Sadly, this wasn't it. Too much grits, small shrimp lacking freshness and watery sauce throughout.",Objectivewi7vAtDnJ0jGfy8b1_POgg,"What a great find in Charlotte! Mert's Heart and Soul is just that- a little bit of food love in the city. 

We went for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. As we pushed open the door- we were greeted by Robin who quickly seated us, took note of my lack of accent and asked where I was from, and got us going with some great cornbread and butter as we sipped our beers and looked over the menu. 

Breakfast? Lunch? Breakfast? Lunch? Well breakfast won out but only by a fraction of a point as the southern fried chicken and mashed potatoes and green beans were definitely calling to me. 

But I went with the omelet with ham and cheese and a side of buttermilk pancakes. My dining companion went with the eggs and country ham (ooh- that is some salty ham!) Both were served with a side of home fries. The food was great. But the service was even better. 

Robin took great care of us, making sure we had everything we needed and told me I just ""had to try"" the cornbread so she brought that out as well. Loved the music- Sam Cooke, and Sam and Dave played through our entire breakfast adding to the ambiance.

We ordered eggs over easy with country ham, grits and a biscuit. As well as a bunch of sides (mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, collard greens, catfish, cornbread). The country ham was wayyy too salty but mix it up with the grits and you're back in business. Things that were excellent: the cornbread, the biscuit, and the mashed potatoes. The catfish was ok, it didn't really taste like anything but frying oil. 

The service was pretty weak. Our waitress forgot to put our side order of catfish in...I know it sounds absurd.. who orders a side of catfish? Anyway, she forgot it and brought us a full catfish meal at the end of our meal which we didn't turn away 'cause it just wasn't worth the trouble. And to top it off she added an extra omelet to our bill. I usually don't check each line item on my bill but I could tell the waitress was a bit of a basket case and was right.

Ordered quarter leg chicken with catfish, sides of collard greens and mac & cheese. Chicken was cooked through but the meat made me think they'd gotten it from a mass market supplier, yet and still no compliants on the taste. Mac & cheese was AweSoMe. Didn't have that stretch-cheese consistensy, more crumblike, no complaints here either. Greens can be made a few different ways, this way wasn't my fave but they weren't nasty, a lil on the tart side but the red onions helped to cut through the taste.

After an absence from seafood for years, I wanted to get back in the ring and decided to try catfish for the first time. This was really good. It was breaded well, seasoned too, and not greasy (neither was the chicken). I like the sauce they give even though it probably just mayo & some other type of dressing mixed together. 

Guy who took my order said the cornbread was on the small side so he gave me two. No recession in this order woohoo! Butter was nice and creamy, cornbread was one of the best I've ever had.

Aside from the crowd that it attracts (sometimes it's hard got get a table from what I remember).... everything is very likable at Mert's.  Comfort food galore!  The place is tucked in the middle of a block, but once you find it, you'll definitely remember where to go when you are hungry.  

I also remember the staff being very good, speedy (to get people in and out) and friendly.",PositiveIJL3f834PHF2WGUUS07lTg,"I love Mert's.  They have the BEST cornbread I've ever had, ever.  
The fried chicken is crispy and juicy.  The mac and cheese is perfect, the mashed potatoes are creamy.  The service is great.

But it's cursed.  Both times I've taken a boyfriend there, he's broken up with me within 2 weeks.  WHY?!  I'm afraid to go back there now, unless it's with friends.  

Also, the first time I went the server accidentally broke the heat lamp right above the food...she stared at it as if she didn't know just what to do, and just picked a few pieces of glass out of the greens...which ended up being MY greens, so I didn't eat them. 

But my mouth is watering at this very moment thinking about that cornbread.",ObjectivezCtAH_NvX-2FPJwUFk1r7w,"I was referred to Mert's and decided to blow off my search for the greatest calamari ever from my last trip to Charlotte...was too cold to wander around downtown.  I'll get back for calamari later.

First off, the cornbread was great!  It was moist but not mushy.  Hate cornbread that sucks all the moisture out of your mouth or is hard as a brick.  

Started with fried green tomatoes -- a new item per the menu!  5 slices to the plate with yummy remoulade.  Then came the shrimp and grits.  Also really good.  

Was too full for dessert but took a piece of lemon cake to go thinking that I'd eat it at the airport for breakfast.  Ended up making it all the way home with it.  Still good and very lemony.  

Jerry was my waiter. He's the man!  Prompt and polite service without being overbearing.",PositiveQZBUPSgkJgQCSH5abZcDaw,Whenever I want to taste my Mom's cooking I just go to Mert's.   The fried chicken tastes just like hers & the strawberry cake that she used to make for my bday.,Objective_ZjwFcWR3N53T46Ty4NjVQ,"In my humble opinion, Merts has the best fried chicken around. I love it so much that I order it every time there! Their mashed potatoes are the kind that are very chunky,...love! You know that it's homemade when you get that. Their Collards are plentiful with a spicy, tangy flavor. The Peach Cobbler was an exceptional dish all on it's own.  It wasn't just regular peach cobbler, there were hints of orange zest and ginger.
   Next time, I vow to try something different and hope to resist the urge to order the fried chicken again!",Positive#NAME?,"I came to Mert's based on a recommendation of a bus driver.  I figure who knows soul food better than a fat guys who's been a lot of places.  Am I right?  

I was pleasantly greeted at the door and brought to the table by my server who promptly brought me a Yuengling nano seconds after I sat down.  I took her recommendation on the combo plate.  I got ribs and fried chicken leg quarter.  My two sides were mac and cheese and collard greens.  Mac and cheese was heavenly.  Collard greens were good but crazy salty.  And I'm a huge salt fan! ""One more Yuengling please.""

Mert's is low key good old fasioned soul food cooking.  Nice work, Mert!",PositiveHq3k7LtMHVHPLiHPC378Ew,"No doubt am I fan. Whether this LBD is craving mac and cheese or collard greens, I know where to go.

I usually order online on ""uptown2go"", so I know to give it about 20 minutes before collecting my meal. Lately, I have been a huge fan of their bbq sandwich. It comes on top of a buttered roll. Now if that doesn't get it poppin, what does?

Being a northern boy, I never really had the opportunity to munch out on some soul food. Let me tell you, this place has gotten me addicted to collard greens. 

They also have good beans and cornbread. And when I want some beans and cornbread, I will go to Mert's for some beans and cornbread. If it wasn't for their beans and cornbread, I'd go somewhere else for my beans and cornbread.

LBD Scale- Easy 8. Now doubt in my mind that this place is a trademark southern soul food boutique. If there's any other places that you recommend, holla at me.

It's hard for me to find something I want without changing a million things around, but Mert's had plenty of choices for me just the way they came. Even if I wanted to be picky, the waitress was more than happy to accommodate and she was on top of her game. Love Mert's and have to go back soon!",Positive00R1zQf2uLV74TYfXEa-vA,"Last year I remembered that this place had a line out the door. We waited last year and we waited this year too. Why? Because Mert's is worth it! 

We were lined up outside for about 20 minutes this time, but found entertainment in a street hustle, where some character asks to see if you have a 100 dollar bill and if so he invites you to bet it by guessing which of 3 bottle caps has a red pill underneath. I was so glad to get in when we did, really not trying to get caught up in a street brawl just in case both that red pill and main man's 100 dollar bill disappeared all at once. 

So we're seated. I ordered a sweet tea, collard greens, mac n cheese, fried catfish, and BBQ beef riblets. Sounds like alot, but the portions are equivalent to a plate of food at a cook out. Nonetheless I was stuffed! The collard greens are excellent, you can taste a little vinegar and they top them with tomato and onion if you don't protest. I enjoyed everything, mac n cheese thick n cheesy, ribs-tender sauce -sweet, the catfish was good n crisp, however I like a slightly spicier batter. But other than that, two thumbs up!! 

The surroundings are pleasant, you see lots of young people laughing and having fun, and proud accomplished HBCU alumni telling their stories around the table! An American dream, the culture here is so rich. This place is worthy of a visit from one of those Food Network Road Scholars for sure! Totally SATISFYING; where else can 5 grown ups eat for $80?

I haven't been to Mert's in a couple of years but ventured in this past wk and it was just as good as I remembered it . 

Solid place for a down home lunch and the prices are pretty cheap. I used to get their pulled pork but this last time I saw the server bring out their BLT to another table and food envy hit immediately! Never would I order a BLT at a restaurant but when you put the BLT on a focaccia bread, I am all over that bad boy. Pair that up with the mac n cheese and I could only finish half of my sandwich and walked out with a tab less than $7.

I inhaled my plate of salmon cakes, mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  The cornbread was tasty and buttery.  The service was fast and friendly, the sweet tea was syrupy sweet and the interior is very entertaining.
My sister enjoyed a dessert - was it sweet potato cake?  Something that seemed a bit odd to me.
As far as uptown southern goes, I'd say Mert's is your spot for casual, friendly, quick but still very tasty - a nice place to hang out with friends.  King's is better for dressy and classy.",Positivelo8neLbH80tMgkJzD4teyA,"We were in Charlotte for a basketball game and to celebrate my son's 20th birthday party.  We were a party of four and  a friend recommended Mert's.  It is not a very huge place at all and it was jammed packed when we got there but we sat almost immediately.  The decor is really cool and service is warm and friend from the time you walkj through the door.

The food is very good!  Not the place you want to go if you are on a strict diet because just about EVERYTHING is fried or fattening but this is the place you go to when you are off the diet wagon lol. They do have salads if you can stand to eat that healthy while your friends and family eat fried catfish and cornbread  :)

We loved the Soul RolIs as an Appetizer.  I had the blackened Salmon which was just okay for me. I was looking for more blackened seasoning for a little kick of spice, but it was ok.  My sweetie is a Lousiana man so he had okra and tomatoe, Shrimp creole and fried catfish. He is a better cook than me believe it or not and he said Mert's did a good job.  He loved it. My sons had fried fish french fries collards.   I loved the flavor of the greens  and I am a good cook so I can throw down on some collards. Mert's did the greens some justice for sure!   My family thoroughly enjoyed their meals and the cornbread and everyone left quite  full!  The prices are VERY affordable so even those on a very tight budget could go here.  and we had a wonderful, attentive and funny waitress named Paris!!!!  

I would definitely go back (when I'm off the diet wagon) and would recommend this place to anyone who likes soul food!",PositiveOktsinXB5suSYV2-rR3wVA,"Mamma better slap me, because I just sinned... 

Let me explain, I just got spoiled, I was rewarded with delicious food, and I didn't do anything to deserve it.  You heard me, landed in Charlotte and after checking into my hotel, I decided to B-Line it to Mert's; because there was a need in me to have some good food, and I got delicious food.  

First let me comment on the service... it was genuinely amazing.  I was promptly seated, and the hospitality was refreshing.  The server helped me patiently figure out what was good, and we settled on Southern Fried Chicken, Collard Greens and Mac & Cheese.  The Cornbread came out first, and it was mildly sweet, and tasty. 

Let's break down the meal.

Fried Chicken:  From the moment I took my first bite of the chicken breast, it was perfect cooked, juicy and hot, the meat was lightly battered, and the batter that was on it, was seasoned well.  It was a one of the better pieces of friend chicken I have had, not dry at all.   I would eat this every day, if I lived here, and I didn't have to worry about eating fried foods.  Recommendation, eat it, yum. 

Collard Greens:  I've had collard greens before, and this was good as most.  Admittedly, never had it with tomato before, but it was still delicious.  I liked the flavor, and the greens were tender, soft but with a nice bite.  The portion of the side was right, and complemented the chicken right.

Mac and Cheese: Yes Sir, this stuff was creamy, delicious, sauce done with tons of cheese flavor.  It was cooked right, because you don't see any sauce/oil separation.  In fact, all you do is taste the various textures, from the small clumps of cheese, to the noodles which are just cooked past al dente, but not much after.  It's like creamy goodness, yummy heaven, sometimes, I think you can make Mac and Cheese just the entire meal. 

Here we go, I love good food... but like a good infomercial... THERE'S MORE!

What in the world is a Sweet Potato Cake?  That's lovely stuff, I had some, and it's like a tasty and the cream cheese frosting was amazing.  I think they spiked it, crazy amazing, not overly sweet, the texture was nice, and it melts in the mouth.

Here's the kicker; I ate all the food and this doesn't really happen much, but it was perfect portion.  I'm 6'1, about 225lbs, and I thought all this southern comfort food would leave me heavy; but nope, it was just the right amount, and all for 15 dollars, with a coke.  

Like many other Yelpers, KICK ASS food. Location isn't easy to find at first, but you want food, and you are in downtown, make this a perfect spot, for you and all your friends.",PositiveA-Kv65mLEvU22SQNwaqYyw,"SUMMARY:  This was about the 6th time I've dined at Mert's.  First time since joining Yelp.  I was disappointed by the exceptionally long time it took for dinner to be brought to our table and by the terrible version of BBQ they offer.  

DETAILS:
We were promptly seated and had our drink order taken.  The drinks came right, and the appetizer (soul sampler) came out in a very reasonable time.  But it took at least another 20 minutes (maybe even 30) to get our entrees: BBQ with sides, and blackened pork chops with sides. And while the sides and chops all got good comments, we did NOT like the very molasses-heavy BBQ.  This is nothing like I've ever eaten in North or South Carolina (and I'm a native).  That needs to be revamped or better disclaimed on the menu.

Anyway, so unlike my previous visits, I left very disappointed and unfortunately, left my out-of-town friends with a bad impression of what has usually been a good place.",NegativeuuLq5lo0Xs6LUGB0B7pK8w,"Love this place!! Food was great!! 

Fried whiting-Meaty, seasoned well and ooooo so delectable 
Mac and cheese-cheesy, tasty and just plain ol good 
Greens-good but didn't really care for the chopped onion and tomatoes a bit tart, next time I will try their string beans 
Cornbread-SOOOOO tasty, moist and sweet! 

My boyfriend got fried chicken, salmon cakes, mac and cheese and yams and he almost bit his fingers off!! He loved his meal 

Service was great, the owner is so nice and friendly 

My only gripe is that their isn't a location in Maryland :-( I will def be back next time I'm in Charlotte!!",PositiveQ476jMMYjhfp_d4w-BoP1w,"All I can say is YUMMM!!! My fiance and I are new to Charlotte so this was our first try at true Southern style soul food. Mert's was not a disappointment. The service was friendly. Very cozy southern feeling atmosphere. Very casual and chill and best of all, not overpriced! 

Biggest recommendations: The cornbread is to die for!!! OMG! The chicken is wonderful and the mac and cheese is soooo good! 

Definitely worth checking out!",PositivepeHz4o-wT0C8Nvx50yw27Q,"Mert's deserves all of the love it is getting and more. I visit every few months for their awesome beef ribs, mac and cheese, and collard greens (I'm a collard fanatic, and these may be my favorite anywhere - and they are veg!). Lots of other good stuff on the menu as well - Soul Rolls, Chicken Tenders, Salmon Cakes, to name a few - but the ribs are hard to pass up.
What really puts my love for Mert's over the top though is the ownership and the consistently good service.
Last night, we visited, and although both Mother's Day and JCSU graduation meant they were packed, we were seated quickly, served promptly, and left happy. It was not the only time we have been impressed with the friendliness of everyone at Mert's!",Positive#NAME?,"Ard took a picture of his beef ribs with his Blackberry. 

Five minutes later: ""It's got 25 Likes! Damn, people are hungry! The economy *is* bad!""

If a mere picture of Mert's ribs gets 25 likes, imagine how many their flavor would get. 

We stopped by after the wildly entertaining nuttiness of Speed Street. After a couple of beers on a hot night, all you need is grease to soak up the booze. That said, Mert's delivered, not greasy food, but high-quality, delicious, heavy Southern food that will absorb anything left in your system, and leave some cholesterol as a gift with purchase. 

I got the Soul Rolls, essentially soulified egg rolls, with black eye peas, collard greens, rice, and a wee bit of diced chicken breast (though I didn't taste much of the chicken. Could have just been my particular rolls, tho). The others got varying dishes of fried chicken and beef ribs, with sides of fries, mac & cheese, collard greens, and the works. 

""You know, if I worked here, they would find me in the back with my head in a bucket of this mac & cheese,"" Ard said.

Yep, basically. Some of the best mac & cheese I've ever had in a restaurant. 

Service is great here, too. Everyone was so patient with the troops of drunk teenagers who wandered in to use the bathroom, despite the sign on the door that read, ""Bathrooms for paying customers only."" Our server, Netta, made sure that I ordered first, as a fellow Netta. So nice! 

I think there's enough reviews here to cover ambiance, so I won't go on about that. But Mert's is cozy and the food is delish. Go enjoy!",PositiveNtOcH1DLtKtg0pSiGVNnQg,"I had the pleasure of taking a coworker to Mert's for her first time today. We had an amazing lunch! The place was packed but we didn't have to wait. The waitresses were super busy with big parties who were there for their Sunday afternoon meals but were no less charming and friendly.

I've been once before and I highly recommend the Fried Green Tomato appetizer that I had last time. The chicken is excellent as is the cornbread. I had Salmon Cakes today and they were out of this world! The mac and cheese is delicious as are the greens and green beans. I could have drank a gallon of their sweet tea but I'm glad I stuck with two. We shared a piece of German Chocolate Cake for dessert. I was good and the whipped cream on the side just melted in my mouth.

I don't know why I waited so long to make a return visit but trust me, I'm going to make it a priority to get back there soon!",PositivenujFvkPhTom2B9d_yDl-3Q,"This place serves excellent Low Country/Country Cooking dishes at reasonable prices - at least the prices are reasonable at lunch, $7 - $9 for a entree which comes with 2 sides and corn bread.

The Fried Chicken is excellent, The Ribs are as well, and I love the Salmon Cakes. The Fried Catfish is good, any of the Po' Boys are worth trying. The Fried Green Tomato app is nice, not as tart as some, but still good. The Collards are not to my liking, and  I've tried them twice.

The Shrimp and Grits are nice, rich and creamy. But, I was disappointed in the Shrimp Creole, was bland and watery. Service here is excellent, even when this place is busy, which it always seems to be. The ambiance is homey, though it can get a little loud.",PositiveqFeo6myprB4OPsbXi-iLiA,First let me say FREE PARKING!!!!

Some of the dishes stood out more than others, but if ever in the neighborhood again, would come back to try out some other dishes.  The location was right in downtown, but there was no problem finding on-street parking on a week night around dinner time.  

We ordered the Soul Sampler, the Southern Sampler, and a side of collard greens, and some sweet tea.  I liked their sweet tea, with the perfect amount of sweetness.  The corn bread lives up to the hype, it had a nice crusty outside and soft inside, and came with soft butter with just a hint of sweetness.  As for the Soul sampler - I didnt care of the ""soul rolls"" (they were like eggrolls with collard greens inside), and the ribs were not your normal ribs (lots of tendons in the meat), but the buttermilk chicken was crispy outside and very tender inside.  As for the Southern sampler - the salmon cakes were flavorful, I liked them, though my hubby thought they were too soggy.  Nothing remarkable about the chicken wings or the fried green tomatoes.  FYI - it seems like each sampler, only comes with 1 piece of cornbread, so if you need more for your party, you may need to order additional as sides. As for the collard greens, the portion was plentiful, but it was too vinegary for my taste.",Objectivebx4bqRZFkgCuCLAU8YNTkg,"Well, this was my first meal in Charlotte, and it kicked my trip off right.

First off, the cornbread may be the very best I have ever had. Perfect texture, a little salty, a little sweet, and hot. Add some sweet butter, and holy moly!

We stopped in for lunch, and the service was a little slow, but there was a huge party, so that impacted things a bit. I had the chopped pork, steamed cabbage, and mashed potatoes.  The only thing that disappointed was the gravy. Everything else was so, so good.

The whole deal, including iced tea was $8.00, which is not far off what we pay for mcdonald's back home.  Yum!",PositiveuZZ7pv01V-3XLuaUEUhtjg,"Soul Food gone Gourmet!!!

Walking by Mert's on my way to the Epicenter, then on my way out of the Epicenter I decided to eat here and am very glad I did!

They were real busy and I sat at a table with two ladies I had never met before (very cool and bold for the waitress to do instead of making me wait)!

I wanted some hardcore authentic bbq and Mert's was my destination of choice.

I ordered their legendary ribs, a side of pulled pork, collared greens and a slice of cornbread.

The ribs were great, hearty, fresh and tasty all around cooked to perfection. I was also a big fan of the collared greens, they were the best I have ever tasted.

Mert's is an awesome spot located right in downtown Charlotte. You really can't go wrong with choosing Mert's, everything on their menu was great.

Had a fun time in Charlotte and an awesome meal at Mert's!",Positive7e8VRuzarH9qwhGZ-h-Zcw,"I dropped in early on a Saturday morning for their brunch, and Mert's indeed definitely has heart and soul. Everyone was really busy and happy, even at 9AM. The service is great, the food is fairly priced, and the ""advertisement"" appeal does not entirely overwhelm the experience.

The brunch fare did not sound particularly appetizing, since eggs are not my favorite dish. I went with a vegetable plate of home fries, yams, collards, and mac and cheese. Best decision possible. $7? Crazy.

With your meal, they bring out their famous cornbread. It is super moist and crumbly on the inside, and it is served piping hot. There is a touch of crunchy crust on the outside; awesome.

The macaroni and cheese has some awesome gooey crust mixed in throughout the large scoop. The collards have onions and tomatoes for a fresh taste. The home fries are a bit different than hash browns: soft and heavily seasoned. The yams have a bit too much sauce; they were a bit too sticky, though nice and creamy.

I also tried a sweet potato pancake. It was slightly bland, but I liked the fluffy texture and little bits of crispness along the ring.

Mert's is quite the institution in Charlotte, so I am sure that it is split between locals and tourists. No matter how touristy it gets, I am certain that it is going to stay for a long time. The service, food, and price make it a great dining experience.

All in all it was a satisfying lunch, but nothing that I would go crazy over.",Objective13LRnG7Wr9NgwMvaVjeVMw,"We went here while in downtown Charlotte.  It was pretty good soul food.  I had fried chicken, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes, however the cornbread they brought the whole table was the best thing I had.  Our waitress was very nice and accommodating.

I went in there because it was next to the hotel I was staying at. I was very pleasantly surprised by the helpful staff and delicious and affordable food. The waitress gave me great recommendations and was very friendly.

I had the salmon cake which was so moist and flavor. Their homemade sauce added even more flavor to the already flavorful salmon cake (I just couldn't get enough of it). The vinegary collard greens had diced onion/tomato sprinkled on top. The corn bread was fluffy and sweet, and on the more moist side (although I have had better - in Boston's Oyster's House to be specific). The Okra & tomatoes was good, but I guess I'm just not a fan of the flavor of Okra, so I would have to say that was my least favorate item of my meal. The entire dinner was just over 10 bucks. Now my stomach is full and happy :)!",PositiveqMOUStQ3fIb4bLiF4wL1UQ,"This pIace earns points for (if nothing else) being open past 8pm on Sunday.

So imagine my surprise when I saw from across the street that Mert's was still open!
I have very little experience with soul food but always wanted to try the place. I expected to pay a bit more than I usually would for a quick dinner but figured it would be worth it to have something different for take-out that I could pick up quickly on foot.

First of all, I'm kind of surprised the reviews are just ""so-so"" for this place, because I was really happy with the whole experience.  I had the lamb chops, and they were well seasoned and cooked perfectly. I was chewing on the bones, which is not typical for me in public. The collard greens are comparable to my grandma's (rural Alabama). The mac and cheese tastes like it's homemade (not Boston Market, not Velveeta, but the real deal). I also tasted the okra and tomatoes and the yams -- everything was just right. 

Ever been to Je's in Newark? For the last 10 years I've been looking for a place that compares to it, and I finally found it at Mert's. Excellent service -- our waiter actually had real conversation with us and treated us so kindly. Same thing at check-out.  We WILL be back. I highly recommend this place.",Positive#NAME?,"Mert's has been around for some time now and they still remain the same in that it's all in what you order which will determine whether you're going to like them or not.

The service is always pleasant and their dedicated patrons will keep them among the soul food favorites in Charlotte.",ObjectiveEd3b_Y9H00xWcv_tu_xI9g,"Awesome fried chicken.

I really wanted to go to Price's but since the conference I was attending ended pretty late, I had to get my chicken fix somewhere else and ended up at Mert's.

I got there around 8 and found the restaurant to be somewhat empty.  Rather than eating there, I decided I would have a better time eating back at my hotel since there wasn't much going on at the restaurant.  It wasn't until on the walk back I realized that the steam from the hot foods probably softened up the fried chicken!  I was prepared to be disappointed...

BUT the amazing thing was that the chicken leg quarter that I ordered was not only juicy, but the skin had somehow retain much of it's crispiness.  As I start to gnaw into the fried chicken, with each bite I was amazed at how flavorful it is.  Didn't need any sauce or anything, it was tasty as is.  Like I mentioned, the chicken is juicy.  Dark meat is always the way to go for me for fried chicken!

With the fried chicken, I also got to choose two sides, so I went for the yams and mac & cheese.  Lots of spices for the yams, and I like how it still retained its chunky form.  As for the mac & cheese, I only liked the part where the cheese had caramelized.  Not too special to me.

It also comes with this awesome cornbread and softened sweet butter.  Cornbread + butter is seriously one of the best combos.  I know butter is good with a lot of things, but when you have a tasty cornbread, butter just enhances it so well!

Even with it steaming in its own heat for around 10 minutes as I walked back to the hotel, the chicken was still awesome.  I can only imagine how great it would've been if I ate there!",PositiveNZ0xOZIWCSESJ-tJ-7OSlQ,"Super friendly service and very quick! Food was good (i had the southern sampler). Cornbread was A+

And Mert's did not disappoint. 

The service was amazing friendly and warm like I was coming to their house. We came at 9pm on a Thursday, it closes at 930pm. But the waiter made sure we knew we didn't have to rush because there was over an hour of cleaning etc to do

Now let's talk about the food. About the amazingness of it. 
My girlfriend and I got two different things and shared. I'll list in order our favorites. 
1. Collard Greens- they were the best I've ever had. They were just done perfect.
2. Fried Catfish- it was cooked and breaded perfectly. 
3. Fried chicken- followed closely by the fried chicken, breaded light but perfectly.
Those 3 were my favorite after that the others were good but not as mind blowing. 
Solid mac n cheese, yams, okra and cornbread with whipped butter...mmmm..
My girlfriend got the salmon cakes they were the only thing that was a disappointment.  Not bad but they were whatever, we killed everything on the plates except the salmon cakes. 

They had a microbrew Carolina Blonde that was a solid beer.

The owners and staff are true examples of southern hospitality, and the food is to die for. Their fried chicken is amazing, collard greens are heavenly (only second-best to my mother's), and without-a-doubt the best cornbread you'll ever eat. The only thing you don't want is their barbecue (its really not at all like traditional NC barbecue). Prices are reasonable and there's rarely a wait.

So needless to say I had high hopes for Mert's. 

I went with the buttermilk and herb chicken fingers which sounded incredible. They were about $11 and came with two sides. Overall they felt flat and had an overwhelming garlic taste that became too much after one or two (and I love garlic -fyi)  I don't think I could eat them again. The Mac n Cheese as my side was a saving grace. Wow-awesome! Cheesy-stringy deliciousness and I ate it right up. My other side was the mashed potatoes which tasted great at first bite but again became overwhelming fast. Perhaps if I went with a veggie side I would have felt better but the food was so rich I felt queasy by the end. My boyfriend ate my cornbread as I don't care for that myself, and he liked it quite a bit. 

I had a bite of my boyfriends steak and eggs which were way overcooked and the steak was literally coated with grease - definitely not my type of thing. He said it was pretty average if a bit overcooked for him as well. 

I thought for the food quality it was a bit overpriced (but pretty standard for the area) and overall I just felt like everything was too salty, greasy, and rich for my own taste buds. Now I know you're probably saying well look what you ordered and perhaps that is true, but I have had fried chicken and mashed potatoes that felt decadent yet somehow less like my mouth was taking a grease bath.  If I went again I would order something MUCH lighter...lesson learned. 

On a positive note the service was fast and friendly and the restaurant itself has a lot of memorabilia that makes for interesting conversation pieces.

We will be back!",PositiveTIcp98nCAd3kYS6gn40NeA,"I give Mert's a high three stars for my first visit. It definitely delivered on my craving for a buttery, salty hot meal. Oh, and some cheese.

The hubs and I rolled up on a Saturday around 2:30 p.m., fearing that no Uptown kitchen is open at such an in-between hour. Au contraire. Mert's was packed. Inside this low-ceilinged nook with couple dozen tables, colorful accents and storied photographs lining the walls, we found couples, families and friends of all ages going to town on some comfort food.

I had the Carolina chopped BBQ, swimming in a sweet, ""secret"" sauce. Served in a side-dish bowl, the Q portion left plenty of room for gooey mac and cheese and a substantial serving of collard greens with the right amount of tang. The hubs had the lowcountry omelette, which was OK for him; he said he'd go for something more fried and/or savory next time (atta boy).

We shared an appetizer of fried green tomatoes--tasty though a tad too bready and lukewarm upon arrival. The app came out after our entrees, but honestly when you've come to indulge in this kind of hearty goodness, does it matter?

And then there was the cornbread. There was a wait for it. Our server was repeatedly apologetic. But oh, was it worth it.

Our server was so very friendly and kept us happy with regular check-ins and refills on sweet tea. My only random nit was the vinyl table covering. I trust it's clean, but there's something kinda sticky about those things still.

I really enjoyed my food.  It was hot and delicious.  The mac n cheese was very cheesy and satisfying.  The mashed taters were lumpy like I like it.  And the cornbread was good too.  A nice little loaf with some creamy, sweet butter.

We sat out on the patio as it was a lovely spring day, and stuffed ourselves with the great food here.  I had the fried tilapia (special of the day) with greens and yams.  It was great, flavorful and well proportioned.  My friend had the fried chicken with mac and cheese and he was raving about it too.

This most recent visit was my return visit to use my unused Groupon of which I had purchased two a year ago. I went with the lamb at the suggestion of the server and the parts of it that were not burnt to a crisp were truly delicious. The potato salad was really good, as was the mac and cheese. The yams weren't even close to those that my Mom makes, but hey..maybe I'm biased. Part of the downfall of Mert's for me is due to the fact that I have had Lawan's and they are on a completely different level. Mert's seems almost a bit commercial to me and it seems that maybe the food isn't prepared fresh (although I did have to wait a long time). 

I'm willing to give them another try, but I don't really want to pay for it so it's likely not going to happen. I love soul food and the people there were super friendly so I wish them continued success, however I'll be heading to Lawan's for my soul food fixes for now.",Objectivep531ZBgdfDBP5wE0m-H2fA,"Brief summary of our experience.  Service sucked ass big time!!  If it was purely based on service alone, it would have gotten a 1 star or 0 stars!!!  If review was based on food alone, it would have gotten 4 stars.  I decided to compromise and give them 3 stars.  

Our sour dining experience starts and ends with Sharon, our waitress.  Bottom line, she was very rude and she needs to be FIRED!!!

After we were seated, took about 5 minutes before she approached our table.  She then gave us 2 straws and did not even bother to greet us or introduce herself to us.  Then she turned her back to us before we could say anything and continued to flirt with the 2 guys in the table to the right of us.  We didn't even get a chance to ask for water.  About another 5 minutes goes by and finally we can order.  She takes our orders but throughout the entire time, we did not have her full attention, her mind was at that table!  After our orders were placed, we got our cornbread BUT she did not give us ANY utensils to eat it with.  I asked another waitress for utensils and she said she would get it for us, but she never did.  Basically, we weren't her table so she didn't want to help Sharon out.  I guess no camaraderie at this workplace.  In the meantime while we were waiting for our utensils, a party of 2 sat to the table to the left of us and they encountered the same issues with her.  They too were served their salad and cornbread without utensils.  We all had to wait at least 5 minutes if not more.  The only good thing about waiting was the table with the 2 guys to the right of us paid and left.  Now I thought she could focus more on us.  I was wrong!!  

She brings us our main dishes, fried chicken quarter and fried catfish with our sides being, mac & cheese, yams, okra with tomatoes, and collard greens.  We also ordered an appetizer and I couldn't believe our main dishes came BEFORE the appetizer.  In the end, we just took the appetizer off the bill because we finished out main courses and the appetizer never came in the interim.  Anyways, we STILL did not have our utensils.  I was pissed!!  We waited anywhere between 5-10 minutes before our utensils finally arrived.  By that time, out food was somewhat cold.  We ate our food ASAP and got the hell out of there!!  If you ever come here, don't get waited by her.  Another thing that irked me, a part of 3 ladies sat in the table to the right of us and she was definitely more friendly to them.  I won't speculate about anything but bottom line, she is a terrible waitress (definitely the bottom tier).

As for the food.  LOVED the fried chicken.  Batter wasn't thick at all.  Light and crispy and chicken was moist and tender.  The fried catfish was good as well.  Lightly battered and fried.  As for the sides, I personally do not like tomatoes and onions with my collard greens.  I prefer the smoke flavored ham collard greens.  If you like the sour/tart collar greens, then this is a place where you can get them.  The candid yams were good, but definitely not the best.  I couldn't put my taste buds on it, but the sugar they use is a little different and it doesn't seem that they used a lot of butter.  The mac & cheese was just okay, I prefer more than once type of cheese in my mac & cheese =P  (i'm just spoiled)  As for the food, I would recommend this place and I would come here again.

When we paid for our bill at the cashier's desk, that lady even knew that we received sub-par service.  She made some jokes to make us feel better about our dining experience.

We put our bones on a plate on the table next to us in an effort to divert them. 

The food is still really good, and we appreciate the friendly service but it is a bit slow. As others have mentioned, the macaroni and cheese is quite yummy.

Came to Charlotte while on vacation and it was on my route.  Parked at the Hearst Media Towers and just went walking.  I saw Mert's and looked up on Yelp and the reviews got me in.  Now, let's be clear on this.  This location is in a nice building, next to a nice Holiday Inn; so don't expect fancy NOTHING.
   The inside looks very well broken in but yet clean and eclectic. Iron metal art sculptures with wood adorn the inside, the kitchen area is open and you can see everything.  There was only two guys back there and may GOD bless them both, they were rockin out some GREAT FLAVOR.
   I was promptly seated then greeted by my server whom said she would be right back to take my order.  As I said this place was busy so I figured I would be waiting on my food.  NOT THE CASE.   As with most places I visit first I say to the servers ""Please bring me food.  Your choice, Your call.  Don't tell me.""  Then I list what I don't eat.  I also asked for sweet tea.
    Understanding that this is soul food, real soul food.  So I was excited.  The tea came, glass was clean.  The tea.  Well, the first glass went down fast and was refilled quickly by my server with a smile.
   Within a few minutes my food was delivered by another server.  Fried Chicken, green beans, and mac & cheese, with cornbread.  I'm happy.
    The green beans had great flavor, very nicely cooked.  The mac & cheese is incredible, was tempted to order a side bowl of this but, hey, already ate like 4 times prior.  I picked the chicken up, white meat; and tried to bite into it.  WRONG!!!!!!!!!!
     I warn you, wait for 20 to 30 minutes till you can get into this.  HOW THE HECK IS IT SO HOT FOR SO LONG?  Darn..  I had to cut into it with a knife to let the heat out.  Once it was safe to eat it, I was first taken to the memory of my mothers and grandma's chicken that was made at home.  Perfectly seasoned, not greasy, but just pure flavor and moist.  I finished off several more glasses of that great sweet tea and cleaned my plate.
    Total bill was about $11, I forgot to keep the receipt, but was well worth it and the server was taken very good care of.
    She offered cake for desert but it was HUGE, no way I could have eaten that and still be functional to see the town that night.  
     Only downside to this place is that it is right off the street, so you get noise from the traffic and flies find their way in.  No biggie, they did not eat much.

Very impressed. My favorite dishes are the salmon cakes and the rice and beans with turkey sausage but that dish tends to be too salty at times. Overall, nice place to eat.",PositiveY0cga-oA7-XM5Q8mDzI2QA,"We came to Mert's after a couple hours of play at the Discovery Place science museum just a few blocks away.

The place was pretty much empty at 5:30, two tables inside and one outside.  I think it may have been a shift change because everything was just a little slow.  It took a few minutes to get us seated, took a few minutes to come get the drink order, then took a few minutes to bring us the drinks.... so from the time we walked in, we did not get to order until about 5:45.

I ordered the Soul Sampler - Buttermilk chicken tenders, soul roll (egg roll with black eye peas, chicken, cabbage), ribs, and corn bread.  

The soul rolls were really good, but came with a honey mustard already on them, which I loved, but would not be good for everyone.  The corn bread was by far the best part, hot right out of the oven.  Happy faces all around for 7 people...4 adults, 3 kids.  

I ordered the catfish and creole combo - the catfish was almost a whole fish, minus the head.....all the fins and bones were still there....  other than that, it was fried to perfection with a really nice batter.  The grease in the fryers must have been really fresh, as I could not taste it in any of my fried food, which is normally the only complaint I could have with fried food.  My creole was lovely 5 out of 5, lots of shrimp and the celery and onions were crisp.  Good flavor, good heat, my nose was sweating a little, but not unpleasant at all.

The BBQ sauce was vinegary and sweet, which was good, but the ribs and pulled pork really just tasted like the sauce.  

The wait staff started to warm up to us at the end, so we finished of nice.  

Would I come again, no... am I glad I went, yep!!  I love soul food, but sadly I have had better in Detroit Michigan.  I would rather go to Sloes BBQ on Michigan Ave.

The green beans were AWESOME, though as you would expect with soul food, cooked until mushy, though the flavor was just subtle and great.  

We were also plagued by fruit flys....when ever there was food on the table, there were fruit flies doing fly bys.....I started to hum, ""Highway to the Danger zone"" but no one seemed to get the reference.",ObjectiveQixtWnKS-iOLJTX7wAoMqA,"The service here sucks. We went there and they got us the main meal before the appetizer and bread.  When I requested to have my appetizer first, the waitress replied that they are expecting lots of people from the convention and they are trying to get us out as fast as possible. I immediately left. 

Never going to go back again.",Negative4dsZvW3keXLbdMNYXtzo8w,"I'm somewhat embarrassed about this review as I work in Uptown, love this kind of cooking, have known Mert's existed but have never gone!  Remedied that on Wednesday morning and seriously had perhaps the best breakfast I've ever had.

I got just the basics - scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries, biscuit and a buttermilk pancake on the side.  OMFG!  Perfectly cooked eggs, two huge sausage patties that were seared on the outside and moist/tender on the inside (yes they were cooked through!)  :)  Everything was just as I would order a breakfast if it were my last breakfast on earth.  My wife had similar but substituted bacon, grits and a sweet potato pancake. she was in breakfast nirvana as well.  Even the coffee was a notch above your typical breakfast joint fare.

AND...  As I sat there eating this deliciousness, I had to stare at the lunch special menu board and there was not one thing on it I wouldn't have ordered.  There is no doubt I'm coming back soon for lunch.

On the service side it was fast, friendly and really nice teamwork among the servers with everyone paying attention to coffee cups getting low, etc.  What a jewel for the Queen City!",Positive34BNf532x_GufT_IGQ-KKg,"O man, this place is amazing!

Ok ok, I'm not an expert in soul food or southern food, but if this is even close to what it is...uhhhh I AM A FANATIC. 

Gotta try the beef ribs and fried catfish combo. The collard greens, okra, rice sides are not to be missed. Fried chicken was great! Cornbread that comes with the meals are not sweet but very very very buttery. 

Only thing I would say was ehh was the salmon cake, that was a bit dry.",PositivelCxM0Ys4Rtv8s7LGTipU5g,"We got take out beef ribs last night.  Yummy!!   I am visiting from TX and a native NYCer.  So I have had my share of bbq.   This was quite tasty.   No one complained about the taste of the food.   But everyone complained about the portions.   For 12 bucks you get a few beef short ribs.   Don't expect to get filled.   Satisfied...yes.  But not satiated.   
The location is nice.  The decor is fitting.  They had a TV blaring which would affect a conversation....though it could also stimulate one or save a bad date.

Maybe I am biased, but I feel this is the kind of food you must be in the mood for. Southern soul/comfort food just isn't something that can be eaten 24/7. 

I had a sampler platter for entree which includes beef ribs, chicken tenders, and Mert's spring rolls. The beef ribs are actually very good! The beef is quite tender and easily come off the bones, and the fact that it's beef rather than your typical port ribs made a huge difference. 

The spring rolls and chicken tenders are just a little too salty, fatty and heavy-tasting for me, but I guess that's the essence of the southern soul food.

Oh, last note, their corn bread is really good, you can tell it's very fresh and home-made.",ObjectivecvItMbTrVwga11SHsEMY0A,"never had anything from here that wasnt absolutely delish! fried chicken is outstanding, like grandma made it. salmon cakes and cornbread, some of the best ive ever had. greens are so good. mac and cheese rivals my grandmothers recipe. banana pudding and sweet potato cake are my favorite desserts here, but honestly you can get anything and you cant go wrong. dont forget to try the soul rolls as an appetizer. so good!! i love this place. i took my family that lives in hawaii here and my bro said that this might be his favorite place to eat anywhere. its one of my favorites too :)",PositivedNn4DDR-JH5_eKHwNwEZuQ,"Promised myself in the breakfast review I wrote in early July that I would go back for lunch.  Check!  Been twice for lunch now and each time walked away fully, full and happy.

First trip brought fried catfish, candied yams and a small salad with blue cheese dressing.  The catfish is fried whole and comes with some spicy, mayo-based sauce on the side.  Splash on some hot sauce and a squeeze of lemon and you get, YUM!  The sides were good as well.

Second visit, I went with the lunch special of the day, beef liver and onions.  OK, I know some of you just went, ""GROSS""!  Don't be haters!  Liver is delicious, especially when it's prepared like this.  Slight char on it and covered in a great tasting   brown onion gravy. Tried the mac n cheese this time and it made me smile also.  They also bring a small individual loaf of cornbread and honey butter with lunch orders.  It is moist and flavorful and is a great add to the meal.

Service was fast and friendly on both lunch visits just like at breakfast.

The entrees tasted like something you would get from the freezer section of the super market, the sides were great though, I might just order a bunch of those if I went back. We went hoping to get some good southern food, and left unimpressed and wanting more.",NegativebcI2FSZubUJmCQ8yUNRTXw,"This place was just OK for me.  I was pretty disappointed with the fried chicken because I felt it could have been more flavorful and more fried.  I was surprised because I would have expected more. The catfish my dad and sister ordered was way more fried than the chicken my mom and me had ordered. Also, don't expect the fish to be a fillet. It's a whole fish.

Even though our server was very friendly, I was also very disappointed with him. It was rare that he came by to check on us and he had also forgotten to give us the corn bread. When he wasn't there to check on us, we resorted to asking a different waitress that walked by for boxes and the check. However, she didn't bother, probably because we weren't her table. Rudeness...

My dad and grandpa live in Charlotte and told us we had to try Mert's.  Cornbread was excellent - we all got our own little loaf as a starter.  Entrees come with two sides and I got the pulled pork as the main dish and okra and green beans.  The pulled pork was a little stringy and very vinegary, but unique.  

Wife got the salmon cakes and I didn't really care for them.  I told her she shouldn't have ordered that, but oh well.  Her mac and cheese was great though.  My grandpa ordered the fried chicken and it looked great and he really enjoyed it.  I tried a few bites and it was very moist and crispy.  I don't remember what my dad ordered...

I like how they have tons of cool side dishes here and they're all soul food-type items.  We have tons of good restaurants in Southern California, but nothing like Mert's.  If I came back, I'd probably order the fried chicken, or the catfish if I'm feeling exotic.  They probably have about 20 or so sides - a good mixture of carbs and veggies - I wish I tried the fried green tomatoes...  Well I'll be back someday to try something different.  I'm glad my dad and grandpa took us here!",PositiveI6kfgR3tqF3td9yAonnZzA,"I love this place.  This is my favorite restaurant in all of Charlotte.

Mert's is definitely good.  
The service was kind, warm and attentive even though it was a bit busy in there.  I ordered the Shrimp Creole dish and by no means was I disappointed. It was saucy plus spicy (those traits can't be wrong in women nor food), small shrimp goodness ladled on top of rice.  The cornbread comes before your meal and good thing I don't judge on the free food.  Just sayin'.

One thing to write home about is the COLLARD GREENS! I could eat a lasagna dish full of just their greens.  It's slightly bitter, balanced out with butter and a slight citrus taste and perfectly cooked.  You must try it!

My only complaint is the cleanliness, the place needs a little TLC especially in the corners that people (unlike me) don't typically look, or don't want to anyway. Give it a rub down.

The fried chicken is so crisp and juicy. My girlfriend and I love the place.,Positive-0RjM8m3WAkon8MWTeFWWg,"Charlotte is an odd city. It appears as if North Carolina needed a place to conduct financial business and girls, wearing the tightest/shortest skirts I have ever seen, needed a place to congregate. Men wearing colorful polo shirts, short pleated shorts and Italian loafers with no socks needed a place to make money and look for the short skirt women. 

The whole city shuts down Saturday and Sunday except for bars and restaurants during the PM hours. Finding a good breakfast place seemed like a daunting task until we found Mert's.

This cozy soul food joint had tons of character and a solid menu. When we walked in, the smell of fried chicken and greens slam you in the face. There were two pots large enough to bath William Howard Taft slowly cooking collard greens on the stove in the back. The griddle was loaded up with bacon and pancakes. Just a beautiful sight. 

I ordered eggs and country ham with home fries and a biscuit. The biscuit was so good i almost ordered another. Instead, i just ate most of my wife's. I also got a pan cake on the side. I honestly dont remember eating a better pancake in years. Lastly, i ordered fried green tomatoes. Very well done. Batter was a little hard but all in all, very good. Also, the tomatoes taste like they spent some time in the fridge.

My wife got the sweet potato pan cakes as well as fried chicken and eggs. The fried chicken was shockingly good. I could have gone back that night to eat more.

The only down side was all the eggs served to our table were under cooked. When i order over easy, i expect to have all the white cooked with a runny yolk. We all ordered over easy and there was a lot of uncooked egg white in everyone's eggs. There is a simple fix for this: order over medium!

Coffee was nice a strong. Syrup was hot. Hot sauce was already on the table. Real butter was served.",Positive1F2dnhZXTgvPEluqX-zjcw,"The most southern style food and restaurant you can find in Charlotte. Fried catfish was good but their chicken was average. 

When I first started working in Charlotte, three months ago, everyone raved about Mert's. So as a ""New York city-slicker"" I got dragged by my coworkers to try ""southern cookin"". 

Nothing super about the food, but the sides are amazing. Mmmmmm cornbread",ObjectiveoAqVe8suBCHpBXOMKpJc0Q,"We've been living in Charlotte for a year now, and we've been to quite a few restaurants in our time. However, while I have found that perfect BBQ joint I dreamed of, I had not yet happened across the quintessential place for good ol' Southern cooking...in particular fried chicken. Well, that is now a thing of the past, for I have found Merts.

You could tell just from walking inside that it was going to be a great Southern food experience. The interior of the restaurant is colorful and eye-catching, and the art and decor screams Southern. The interior was full to capacity, but we were able to snag a table outside. The outdoor area is a mixed bag. While it's nowhere near as crowded as inside (with only four tables or so) the Charlotte pedestrians take it upon themselves to walk through the outdoor area. It was a bit disruptive to be eating a nice meal while people constantly walked right against your table. 

I wasn't a fan of the beer list since Merts does not carry any drafts, so I stuck with unsweet tea. After placing our orders the server came over with a small loaf of cornbread for each of us. This cornbread was spot on for me! Not gritty, a little sweet and extremely crumbly. You could tell it was fresh from the oven, and that made it super awesome!

For dinner I ordered the beef ribs and leg quarter fried chicken combo. I wasn't crazy about the ribs themselves, as they were a bit tough and chunks of bone kept flaking off. I did enjoy the sauce, as it was a sweet and tangy sauce and not vinegary. Now the chicken was THE BOMB! I've been searching for fried chicken down here, and have been disappointed time and again. So far I am confident to say that Merts has the best fried chicken (though I haven't made it over to Price's yet, so don't jump on me for that yet.) The battered skin was light and crisp, and not greasy. The interior was that moist and juicy you expect from fried chicken. I was in heaven scoffing that chicken down, and I wish I had more right now! 

The miss' ordered the catfish and fried chicken breast combo, and that was also pretty dang awesome. The catfish was a huge filet just plopped on the plate. The meat came right off and was so light and tasty. The batter was also perfect, with not too much that didn't take away from the soft flavor of the fish. They serve it with this spicy sauce that was a good compliment to the fish. The chicken breast was just as good as my leg. Even the white meat stayed juicy and tender! The miss' didn't eat too much of it after filling up on the fish, so there are plenty of chicken leftovers in my future!

The other thing that Merts does damn good is sides. One problem I've had at BBQ and other places down here is that the meats are perfect, yet the sides are extremely lacking. Merts has some of the best dang sides money can buy. We both ordered the mac & cheese and it was simply the best I've had down here. Some places I've been to make it watery or oily or just not flavored right, but Merts had it all. It was a firm consistency with a great cheesy flavor, and the cheese crust on top was awesome. I also tried black eyed peas for the first time and loved them. They were cooked perfectly and were served in this kind of gravy that was also tasty. The miss' ordered the collard greens and I have to say that I liked those too. I'm generally not a fan of collards as they are bitter, but these were cooked in such a way that the bitterness was taken down a notch or two. They had some citrus flavoring to them that helped tone it down and added a different level of flavor to. All in all, the sides kicked butt! Unfortunately we were so stuffed from this massive meal that we did not stick around for dessert.

I have to say, when I think home cooked Southern fare, I will always associate it with Merts. They can fry up some mean chicken and fish, and their sides and veggies are top notch. It's a busy place but it is definitely worth the trip.",Positives2z5wnUK3Nm2scgknl_q4Q,This is a great place to eat! The people there are so nice and the food is fantastic.

I have been to Mert's four times in the past year and have been pleased with each visit. The service and ambiance is great. The art and music promotes an inviting warm home-style environment.

I'm only giving this place 3.5 stars because of the food. It is tasty, but not the best southern cuisine I've had. I was raised on southern cooking and am aware of variations in seasoning and techniques for one location to another. However, although good, the food does not satisfy my appetite when I'm in the mood for ""soul food"" or southern cooking. I'm sure this varies from one person to the next.

Classic Southern soul food. Collard greens and fried okra and fried chicken and sausage gravy and all those yummy things that just put weight on when you mention their names! I was tempted by so much but when the waiter mentioned their specials, I knew that the grilled pork chop in white gravy was for me. And it was. Excellent and tasty with lots of flavor and spice, I cleaned the plate and then picked up the bone for chewing. Great stuff. For sides, I had the mac & cheese (excellent!) and the yams (only meh).

For dessert, the peach cobbler was only okay - an overwheming spiciness. I think that I might have just gotten a bad scoop, because my friend who had it really liked his. The vanilla ice cream gave it the right consistency, but the flavor wasn't right.

I understand it's not a four star restaurant, however the batter on the popcorn shrimp could have more crispy.  Perhaps the fryer was not to temperature when they sunk them.  Despite the spiciness of the potatoes they where fresh and not cooked that long, although personally I do like crispy home fries.  Having said that portion was good size, price average with other restaurants in the area.  Service was my biggest issue.

The fried chicken is excellent and I don't think I would ever order anything different here.  I've had the salmon cakes and the pulled pork BBQ, both were just OK.  Just get the chicken and thank me later!  The corn bread they bring you during lunch and dinner is amazing.  It's always been piping hot and serves as a nice base for your meal.

Now for the bad: the service and breakfast fare.  I've had spotty service several times.  My mother wanted to substitute a few small things on the menu and her requests were all denied the last time we were there.  Very unaccommodating.  A small upcharge was not even suggested.

I don't need anymore directions than that at Mert's, which might be my favorite place in the Uptown Charlotte area.

This is where I take my out-of-town friends, especially ones who have never experienced what a brick of cornbread looks like, especially one that comes with housemade honey butter. The tea ninjas (or wait-staff) make sure our cups never runneth empty and might tell us some jokes here and there. We'd always eat our vegetables if they were like the ones here: macaroni and cheese (I know, not a vegetable), collard greens (got a little pico de gallo), and the okra stew are some of the best. The Daily Fixin's have some classic choices like fried chicken and catfish, but I really love the salmon cakes, which come with sauce that'd be great on burgers. You'll be fuller than a piggy bank on pay day, but some banana puddin'(g) is a spectacular dessert.

I love the album cover decorations and the music that comes from them-all Motown and Stax classics. Soul music is where a lot of the ""Soul"" comes from; the rest is from the quirky decor and the buzzing of conversation from families out to dinner or couples before/after a play. The whole place has old theatre posters and sepia photographs, not because it's ""cool,"" but because Mert's is a beloved part of Charlotte. The bankers across the street even banded together to keep it afloat during a rough financial period.

Starting with a positive - the cornbread was sensational, served piping hot with honey butter.  Our server 'fessed up it was made with mayo when I pressed for deets.  Lawdy have mercy!  It was durn good though.  The fried chicken was just as excellent as you expect.  Collards and okra got a thumbs up from me.  Okay - now for the negs - The salmon cakes were downright not good.   Disappointing, as they were touted as a featured menu item on their website.  I wonder if I just got them on a bad day??  They were mushy, with no discernible salmon chunks, and flavorless, desperately needing spices or at least salt.  I saw and tasted no evidence of the mirepoix and Cajun spices described as part of the dish.  Hubs didn't like his green beans (too sweet) and home fries (too bland, not fried long enough).  

I like the vibe of the space a lot.  But it does seem a little dirty.  Also our server was very friendly but repeatedly sneezed into the crook of her arm and just kept on serving.  Um, kinda gross from a customer perspective.  She also mixed our ticket up with another tables, but then let us know that she would cover the extra on their ticket for us.  They were busy.  These things happen.  

All in all, I think this is worth a visit for out of towners, especially if you are staying right down town.

Add a sweet tea to it as well! Cannot go wrong with that!

Then she suggested the sweet potato pie, which was AMAZING!!! It was so fluffy and tasty! And it was a nice portion as well!

Then I went back later for my second dinner and I got the shrimp and grits, which was a southern classic and that was very good as well! I cannot complain, the service was amazing, they took care or me there and they really are very kind and nice to you!

Even if you're in town for an extended stay, Mert's should fall on your radar within in the first few days. 

Where I'm not a huge soul/comfort food goer on the regular, the fried chicken, fried catfish, mac n' cheese and other sides have all sang beautifully upon my many visits. One thing that sticks out more frequently and consistently beckons my palate is the lemonade. Goodness gracious, it's that good. Sometimes, I think of stopping in just for a big glass to go. 

One thing to keep in mind about Mert's is that it functions quite differently than other Uptown culinary hearths. This place is busy throughout the week and the weekends. Not uncommon for them to be on a wait well into a Sunday afternoon. Plan accordingly, should you find yourself visiting during any ""peak"" hour. 

Service is ever-so friendly and I love the ""shoe art(?)"" in the men's bathroom. Kind of odd, but definitely worth a gander if you've never seen it.

I also wish they had Tobasco or Louisianna Hot Sauce because Texas Pete and whatever Mexican and Vietnamese sauces just aren't really appropriate with this food in my opinion.

The fish had bones in it and one got caught in the back of hubby's throat. The greens and yams were ok. The WORST was the red beans; tasted like they were cooked in a caldron of hell. I got peach cobbler and could not eat it because it was disgusting!!! Horrible!!! If I go to a place especially a mom and pop and spend almost $40 for 2 dinners and 2 desserts it should be excellent.

The rest of the meal, food and service, was mediocre at best. To tell the truth, the service ran along the lines of pretty poor. We sat outside and the tables around us were annoyed with the bad service too. Actually the woman at the table of three directly across from us kept telling customers to ""go away"" when they came dine. She also was served the wrong meal but no one ever came back to check on her.

We started the meal with the fried green tomatoes - Fresh green tomatoes battered in a herb and flour blend, lightly fried to perfection and served with our own remoulade sauce - it was served with our cornbread and the server said she would return with side plates but never did. She never refilled our drinks either. The fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them. It was hard to find ""tomatoes"" in the dish. I would resist trying this appetizer.

We waited a long time for our main course which is why it was probably cold when it arrived at our table. Scott had the special beef tip omelet with potatoes. He had asked for wheat toast but we were told they had none and they would bring white. They never bought the toast or asked if his meal was good. I tried the Mert's famous salmon cakes. These were dry and cold and my sides the macaroni & cheese - tasty - and okra & tomatoes - greasy? - were also suffering from being left sitting waiting for someone to bring them to our table.

I first visited this restaurant before I moved to Charlotte. I was walking Uptown one day and decided to give them a try. Once I saw that they served soul food, that was it for me. For one reason it is very hard to find restaurants nowadays that are homey and laid back. It feels like home when you walk in the door. You've gotta be crazy to not like the place. They serve everything from fried chicken, corn bread (with each meal), BBQ beef ribs (since I don't eat pork , that was definitely a winner for me), and lamb chops. My favorite sides are their mac & cheese, collard greens and sweet potatoes. At first taste, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I felt like I was in my Mother's kitchen again.

Good flavored coffee was a welcome beginning , as was the yummy cornbread and crunchy biscuits.
5 stars would have been given , but some in our party said their omelette choices were just ok.
My non traditional meal of salmon patties, collard greens and home fries was yummy!  Everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I look forward to a return to this place.

I've ate at Mert's three times, and I haven't had a bad meal yet. Their salmon patties are great alone, but put their remoulade sauce on it and it's perfect, seriously! Their catfish is nicely breaded and flaky, and their sides are equally wonderful too. I've tried most of them and they're all spectacular.

I liked it so much that I asked for more when my entre arrived. I had the salmon cakes, which were the best I have ever eaten. These are not your grandma's salmon cakes- no canned stuff here. This was fresh salmon which they poach in house. It was perfectly seasoned, nice and moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. It is served with a remoulade that compliments it perfectly. My two sides were candied yams and okra and tomatoes. The Yams were delicious- not overly sweet but still nice and gooey and pleasing. The okra and tomatoes were good, although interestingly enough, there were no tomatoes in my serving. Just okra. It didn't matter. I gobbled it up anyway. Everything was served promptly and at the proper temperature, the dcor was warm and welcoming, and the service helpful and friendly.

The salmon cakes were pretty good, potatoes were so so, and I don't even remember if the green beans were good... I'm just sort of disappointed based on what I thought it would be like. The service was ok, nothing extraordinary and I felt the same about the food I ordered. Shortly after walking out, my stomach was so upset, and stayed that way for a couple of days.

Waitress sold us on her favorites which, for us, was dead on.  The beef ribs and pulled pork melt in your mouth delicious with an outstanding tomato and vinegar based sauce.
Sides of okra, collards, Mac & cheese paired well. The sampler platter was very unique for a BBQ joint and is a must to try if your are willing to try something new.

The cornbread that everyone raves about? Totally deserving. The best I've had at any restaurant, ever. The fried chicken was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside -- again, tops.

The mac and cheese was extremely tasty, and I think I'd have a tough time getting my kids to leave the restaurant once they tried it!

My server was gracious and sassy, just as I like 'em. When I ordered a dessert ('nana puddin') after the meal, she told me it was really good and I'd better save her a little taste. But I couldn't do it. The food was so good, I wished I had two mouths and two stomachs. She pretended to be mad at me for eating all the pudding, but I think she was happier with the generous tip.

I had the Salmon Cakes:

- It was done very well, the outside was perfectly crispy and the inside was soft delicious salmon.  The sauce that goes on it was delicious too, I have no idea what type of sauce it was, some type of spicy mayo; superb.

- Candied yams that came on the side was perfect for my sweet tooth.

- Corn bread.  Not the best that I've had, but a good balance between moist and dry.

- Macaroni + Cheese, was good, nothing too special, but still good.

Before all the food came out, the plate of 3 hot and piping corn breads were served with butter.  Very fresh, right out of the oven.  Don't eat too much of this corn bread or you won't be able to finish your meal.

The salmon cakes came with a spicy aioli - very tasty salmon cakes and I like the aioli.  

The fried chicken was darn good!

The fried catfish - even better!  No fishy smell.  Just fresh catfish with that nice spicy aioli.

Sweet tea and a corn bread CAKE were brought out right away. It was the size of a small pound cake and I knew I was in for trouble! I ordered the salmon cakes, greens and mac & cheese. Salmon cakes had lost their crispness on the outside, but the flavor was delicious. The greens were leafy and large and JUST RIGHT! And god bless the mac & cheese. Oozing with buttery cheesy goodness and a touch of the topping that had baked up brown and I may as well have died and gone to heaven.

I just wanted to keep eating, savoring each bite despite being so full I could puke. My lips were doing that quivering thing from being so full. This was one of the most memorable meals I've ever had.

Conveniently located in the heart of downtown, Mert's is the textbook example of what soul food means. The environment is casual and affordable, a bit jazzy, and very Southern. I felt like I was in a grandmother's kitchen, full of history and down home hospitality.

My run down of this epic meal can't do the flavors justice. 

The cornbread was the best I've ever had, no competition. It was thick, warm, not crumbly, very sweet. It was a meal in itself. 

The green beans were prepared in such a way that leads me to believe this is not a choice for the health minded. They were juicy, wonderfully greasy, and contained spots of other wonderful veggies and greens.

The candied yams were a treat. Each bite melts in your mouth as the flavors build in your mouth. A tad of cinnamon, a tad of syrup, a lot of velvety sweet potatoey love. My husband told me that these were the best thing he's ever eaten in his life.

Finally, the fried chicken breast was something of legend. The exterior texture was addicting but not salty or typical in anyway. The poultry itself had a ton if depth in terms of flavor, and tasted as if each inch of it was personally marinated somehow with a hint of smokiness, rotisserie, sweetness, peppery... Just a bit of everything. There isn't a fried chicken that can come close to Mert's as far as I'm concerned. 

If you are in the Charlotte area, Mert's is a must. Not eating here would be the biggest missed opportunity while visiting.

The catfish that I  ordered was a fillet with a lot of batter on it although it was seasoned nice it was just to much breading for me ( and i thought i was going to get the whole fish not the fillet).

The mac and cheese was not to my liking at all it tasted like it was made with velvetta and other cheap cheeses.The fried chicken was lightly fried and not crispy either but the collard greens were well seasoned.

I was a little confused when my food came, because the menu says that it's a whole fish, and that the meat comes easily off the bone. Whatever I got was a filet. I asked about it and the server told me the whiting is larger. I probably should have asked how the catfish was before I ordered it. I can not recommend it.

It's just ok in my opinion.  I had a combo platter when I came: beef ribs, fried catfish, collards, and Mac and cheese.  The beef ribs were not quite what I was expecting or really would have ordered if I had known.  They were the short kind - and in this case, emphasis on short.  There was very little meat on them. The BBQ sauce was too vinegary for my tastes, just ok.  The catfish was solid, but again, when I was eating it I still didn't understand the hype.  The collards were the best part of the meal (delicious take on a classic), and the Mac and cheese was good too, though under seasoned. 

My partner had the salmon cakes, which were very good.  I don't remember what else she had, but this aspect was memorable and quite good.

We both had cake for dessert, which again were good but not outstanding.

The atmosphere is cool here. I like the bright colors and the VERY friendly and courteous wait staff.

We parked in the garage in the same block.  The fee is validated by the restaurant.  I was very excited to try this place because my family has eaten here before and said they love it. The first thing I noticed was the floor, is was so slippy from grease that I almost fell even wearing flat shoes.  The second thing I noticed was that our waitress was just not having it that night.  She apparently didn't feel like smiling, talking, or having any patience that night.  She was so unfriendly that my uncle actually thanked her for taking the time to take our order to try to lighten her mood.  At least that made her smile. As we waited for our food I noticed two more things...the decors is pretty cool; a lot of signed and framed broadway show posters and antique bicycles, and the corn bread is amazing.  I ordered their famous salmon cakes since 1. they are famous 2. I love crab cakes 3. I love salmon. Unfortunately I did not care for them.  The flavor was really fishy and the texture was pasty.  Having cats as pets, this entree really reminded me of their canned food.  My sides were the collard green and macaroni and cheese.  This was the cheesiest and most comforting comfort macaroni I have ever had.  My husband ordered the special of the night which was pork chops stuffed with apple corn bread.  He loved it.  I sampled some of the kids' chicken tenders which were hands down the best chicken tenders I've ever had.  I even enjoyed them cold the next day.  I was not surprised that the floor was like an oil slick being that many menu items were fried.  During our dining experience the servers sang a birthday song to a customer at another table.  It was the best birthday song I've ever heard at a restaurant.  The servers were enjoying themselves singing too.  Overall my family was satisfied with their meals.  The quantity is large and the prices are low.  I took a piece of sweet potato cake home and shared it the next day with my kids.  It was still very moist and delicious.

The two of us stood at the door waiting for someone to come to the front for about 5 minutes. Then, when someone finally came, they started to seat everyone else before even noticing my dining companion and I. When they figured out we were going to order take-out, they shafted us to the side and told us they'd take our order later. Another 10 minutes went by and they just kept seating people. FINALLY, 15 minutes after we'd entered the store, someone found the time to take our orders at the register. We then waited another 20 minutes for our food to get cooked and packaged to go. Luckily, we weren't hungry...

I ordered the salmon with cajun seasoning and sides of collard greens and okra. For $16, the salmon and sides were just an ""OK"" value for money. The salmon was at least 4 - 5 oz but the cajun flavors were much more bland than I remembered them to be. The collard greens were good! Sweet and flavorful with its texture being soft but not mushy. The okra was on the sour side and probably not something I would order again, but still tasted okay. 

The cornbread was actually a HUGE disappointment. I consider myself a cornbread lover and expert. I don't mind them dry, moist, sweet or salty just as long as it has good flavor. Mert's was neither sweet nor salty...if anything it may have been the blandest cornbread I'd ever tasted. Dry on the outside, moister on the inside...but still not enough to make it interesting enough to eat. I almost NEVER leave cornbread behind, and yet for Mert's...I left maybe 80% behind.

I started with the soul rolls, but thought the mixture of flavors and textures did not harmonize well.  It seemed to be a fried app just for the sake of being fried.  But without the pleasing crunch I expected.
But the real let down was my shrimp and grits.  What they served me was a bowl of lumpy grits (one particular lump was too big for my spoon to handle) swimming in a truly awful brown mess.  The color made me think the sauce might be rich, but it was the opposite.  I could probably recreate the flavor with water, thickener and food color - that is just how tasteless it was.  The shrimp had a strange texture that made me think it came from a can.  Then someone had chopped raw green onion and stirred it in.  That was it.  No seasoning.  No flavor.",Negative5N9KChJeOizzG3mffLUaXA,"Had dinner here while in town from LA. Great location; walking distance from hotel.

Interior is decorated in sepia with family photos old and new that lend to the idea that this is a family-owned business proudly serving great home style cooking to the community; a family tradition. 

I ordered the fried whiting plate which comes with two sides and cornbread; I got collard greens and macaroni and cheese. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits with a side of yams. My fish was hot and crispy just like I like and well seasoned. I added hot sauce (Cholula) which added just the right zing. The greens were cooked perfectly (taste and texture) and the mac n'cheese was good (not great). My husband enjoyed his shrimp and grits and gobbled one of my whiting fillets to go with. He got a side order of grits later because there was so much gravy on his dish. He said the addition made it perfect.  I kept taking spoonfuls of his grits because they were so deliciously prepared. I'm a snob when it comes to grits and Mert's does it right! The hubs never got his yams and the waitress did not protest when he brought it to her attention and asked to take it off the bill.

consider actually checking on the food. All the tables around us came, ate and left. Meanwhile, our server could not even remember to bring water to the table without being asked multiple times.

Otherwise she offered to discount our meals and offered us what we thought was another round of beers. She did not even follow through on that promise. We were given one free beer each. Pathetic.

We ended up ordering one of the specials after seeing them on a chalkboard, only to find out after some more confusing, disinterested interaction with our waitress that they had stopped the special just minutes before (9:30am).  Don't know what that meant; did they run out of spinach?  Strange. We ended up with two other omelettes, the garden and the shrimp creole.  We had to ask three different waitresses for our accompanying toast and biscuit, and once we had our food, our waitress interrupted our prayer to ask if we needed ketchup (understandable, but most servers notice bowed heads, even if it's kinda awkward).

I was in town earlier this month with my Mom and toddler while we visited my youngest brother who was working in nearby Kannapolis.  We were able to sit down right away and outdoors which was great.  However, we were highly disappointed by the food.  And, the experience is still memorable enough for me to write about now.

First, they were out of the fried green tomatoes which we wanted to try and we were actually there relatively early to when they opened.  The eggroll-style appetizer that was recommended instead was good but definitely within the same criteria of what we were looking for.  99% of the menu has fried food which my brother was most disappointed about since we chose the restaurant without too much input on his part.  My Mom and I decided to share the Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes.  While the size was decent, the taste was lacking and I felt it might be slightly under-cooked.  For our sides, we chose greens and the red beans both of which were just ok.  And, I will actually say the greens were my favorite food out of what I had if forced to choose.  My brother ordered the Shrimp Creole which just tasted like tomatoes and the shrimp was not popcorn style as described on the menu.  If it had tasted better I think my brother could have been happy that he found something not fried on the menu even though he had decided if he was going to make a diet exception that he was looking forward to it being popcorn shrimp.  After our waitress checked on us she said as a person from New Orleans had we asked her she would have told us that the Shrimp Creole is not on her recommendation list.  However, because other customers have enjoyed it she does not deter people form ordering it...tough position to be in I guess.  My brother also ordered the potato salad which was very heavy on the mustard and vinegar.  I'm accustomed to this style of potato salad but like I said it just had too much mustard for my liking.  My daughter had the chicken tenders from the kids menu which I found to be on the salty side but she seemed to enjoy them.  She also liked the okra and tomato and yams sides that we ordered for her.  The server was nice and she took decent care of us.  She forgot more coffee like my Mom requested but we also noticed that she seemed to have several tables.  

Overall I would say I'm not likely to give it another chance just because it seemed like we were in an area with a lot of choices which might have been a lot better.

I took my servers suggestion and ordered beef ribs and fried fish.  It arrived along with sides of macaroni and cheese and black eyed peas.  The black eyes were some of the best I have ever had.  The beef ribs were really short ribs and were gristly and disappointing.

My first visit was to pick up some catering for an event and I didn't get a chance to try anything. The second visit was a bust I ordered the chicken wings, cabbage and seasoned rice. Meh, I've had better everything. The chicken wings were just okay, and the cabbage and rice didn't have enough seasoning for my tastes. 

But this last visit was much better. 


We started with the Soul Rolls which come stuffed with chicken, rice, greens and black eye peas. They come topped with a spicy honey mustard sauce and were very good. They were crispy and packed with the filling. I'd recommend them. They also bring out some cornbread and that was definitely a highlight for me! It was warm and with some butter....it practically melts in your mouth. 

For my meal I had the pork chops, macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes. I was impressed with the amount of food you get! Two juicy and well seasoned (yay!) pork chops blackened with delicious seasoning. Very good. For me, the sides were just okay again. I'm not sure what to get that will give me that ""amazing"" feel but I guess I'll keep trying....

The greens were soaked in garlic and had entirely too many stalks. The macaroni and cheese was tasty but in conjunction with everything else on our plates was room temperature. Tiger wood drinks were very tasty. Our server was not at all attentive to our needs. If she would have given us her name I would have very well called her out in this review. She did refill our drinks once and left the remaining glasses of lemonade and sweet tea on the table which implied.....self serve. My fiance absolutely loved the cornbread loaves and fried whiting. I detested the cornbread loaves. The initial one that I received had obviously been sitting out too long. It was cold. When I mentioned it to the waitress she informed me that she knew the loaves were left out and that a new batch would be up any minute. She did bring a fresh loaf but I was just flabbergasted that she would serve something she new shouldn't have been served. Overall, the experience was not very pleasing.

I had the Southern Fried Chicken Breast with Collard Greens and Black Eyed Peas. Unfortunately the Collard Greens was all that I was impressed with. It tasted amazing and topping them with freshly diced onions and tomatoes were a nice touch. But the Fried Chicken and Black Eyed Peas were just EH~. I expected the Fried Chicken to have more flavor. But it didn't. It also tasted too dry and not moist at all. I also expected the Black Eyed Peas to have more flavor or richness to them since they are usually made with bacon or ham hock.

Now I do have to admit it was my first time eating here. And I'm sure there are probably other items on the menu I would have enjoyed just as much as the Collard Greens. But with any restaurant I go to, first impressions matter. My theory is with any good restaurant their entire menu is good no matter what you order, which is what makes me want to go back, make it a favorite destination, and want to keep going back to try EVERYTHING.

We'd definitely go back & recommend it to others.",Positive7EHXOCMWJXlcM_D07mjcUA,"I thoroughly enjoyed the cornbread, but my other two companions thought it could have been sweeter.

I ordered salmon cakes, Mac and cheese, and green beens. The greenbeans were over cooked, but the mac and cheese was amazing! The salmon cakes were a little better than ok, I've had better though. Overall I was very stuffed at the end of my meal.

My friend has the soft shell crab po boy with greens and loved it! The greens were cooked perfectly-not overdone.

My wife had the whiting dinner with greens and yams, and loved the fish! She said that the yams had a weird taste-like they added vanilla or something.

From a service perspective, our waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed. She had so many tables! She was moving the best that she could, damn near running. 

Overall, my experience was just ok, but nothing memorable. Although nothing was awful, I wouldn't come back.",NegativeKmFqURhOYjrClHo3QmZxeQ,"I really, really wanted to like this place.  But unfortunately, when I was served chicken that was not fully cooked inside, that really just nose-dived this place to 2 stars.

We were recommended this place by a local coworker of mine since I was in Charlotte on business.  Apparently this is the place to go for some good ole greasy soul food.

BF and I started off with the salmon cakes appetizer ($7.60) which were delicious!  The ""remoulade"" sauce that it comes with is perfect with the salmon.  I ordered the southern fried chicken leg with collard green and mac n cheese ($8.79).  BF ordered the fried catfish with collard greens and mac n cheese($15).  And all meals come with a piece of their infamous corn bread -- which was easily the best cornbread that I'd ever had.

Everything was great until I got into the center of my chicken, where it was uncooked at the bone.  Our waitress came to check on us and saw my chicken and started to apologize profusely.  She took my entire plate and said she would get me a new chicken leg.  On the way to the kitchen, she showed another waitress the leg and they both started shaking their heads.  She eventually came back with a fully cooked chicken leg at no extra charge which was cool, but I was almost full since I had eaten almost half of my previous chicken before I got to the raw part.

The rest of the food was great and the prices were definitely favorable, but it was unfortunate that I ended up with the uncooked chicken.  Not sure if I'd come back next time I am in Charlotte on business.",NegativeIJcDXAfBwV27NNRRhIwArQ,"Omg best service and food ever!! We tried the beef ribs and fried chicken, most juicy food ever! Hands down the best cornbread ever :) this California boy is digging NC soul food haha",PositiveNCgnRPB0VARaGdNer5JY3g,"Let me start by saying I have been here numerous times and the food is a 10. Today, we had the fried chicken which was perfectly crispy, Mac n cheese just like your grandmothers, greens like you have never had before and the amazing cornbread. We even ordered a piece of strawberry and coconut cake to go for our 3 hour drive home. Today, I was beyond disappointed. The service was a 0. The hostess was kind and seated us-I should have left her the tip. Our server came and never made eye contact with either of us. After I told her my order she repeated something completely different. So, I repeated it again as she turned around to check out the guys who walked by to sit at the table behind us. We ordered coffee in which took 10 minutes to get and we were never offered a refill. Actually, the server did not even bring our food and only came back tothe table when it was time to take our plates. Finally, we track her down to ask for the cake and a box to go. She brings the cake but no box and seemed frustrated when I ask for the box again. My boyfriend spoke up and ask for the check. She laid it down and walked off. I decided to pay at the door only to be told to go back to my table and my server would have to take my payment. I told her I didn't want to wait. She said I will have her come up. Then, 5 minutes later she came upset and rang me up and laid the my receipt down and said you can just leave the signed copy here and walked off. Never have I ever actually left a restaurant and not left a tip. Today was the first time  I have actually had my dining experience ruined by poor service. I did not leave a tip. It's really a shame because as I said the food here is exceptional but I refuse to go back to such poor customer service.",Negative1GIwcb7GeRQ4qcylYmYqrw,"I came to Charlotte for a work related conference and decided to come to to Merts for lunch on a Sunday based off of a recommendation from a coworker that had visited a while back.  Maybe it was because this joint was so hyped by my coworker, but Merts kind of disappointed me.  I took a stroll from my hotel and arrived at Merts and the first thing I see is a line out the door.  I think to myself ""This place has got to be good if people are willing to wait outside on a cold and cloudy day like this.""  I step into Merts and the first thing I notice is the dim lighting.  While it the environment looked comfy, it was just so jam packed that immediately I thought about leaving and coming back at a later time.  In the end I just decided to get takeout.  Since the place was so busy, it took me a long time, maybe 10 minutes? to place an order.  Then I waited another 20 minutes for them to get me my food.  Maybe it's just the Sunday Lunch rush, but the place is way understaffed and way too small to cater to so many patrons. 

Now onto the food.  After receiving my food I walked back to my hotel to enjoy some BBQ.  I want to start off by saying that the cornbread that came with my food was probably the highlight of the meal.  It was just that good.  I also got mac and cheese, BBQ ribs, and green beans.  The mac cheese were definitely disappointing, not very gooey with cheese and was just overall something I could have made better at home.  The ribs while tasty, were over sauced and a bit tough.  The green beans were just green beans and I didnt have too high of an expectation for them, but they were so mushy and watery that I couldn't believe that Merts would serve it and charge money for them.

Overall, the experience was kind of negative, but I haven't given up on Merts.  A lot of people seem to have had a good experience here and I will definitely give it another shot the next time I'm here.",NegativecxDTQvWYTl-pxwehTHnaMA,I cant say enough good things about this place...

I had been wanting to eat here for years, especially after seeing them on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. I'm such a foodie so I love trying new places.

Hate that we had to pay to park, but that's the downside to eating somewhere in the city. It was a beautiful night and we got to eat out front. Food was GREAT. Service, not so much. We were seated before another table, and they were greeted and brought drinks out to. I had to get up after about 10 minutes of sitting there and ask if we had a server. The hostess said our server was busy so she'd take our drink order. Right after that, he came over to our table and got our order.

First, they bring out the cornbread. Omg! Best freakin cornbread I've ever had in my life!! It was so moist and just absolutely delicious. I ordered fried chicken, bbq beef ribs, mac n cheese, and green beans. The fried chicken was a little disappointing as I anticipated it to have more flavor than it did. It was kind of bland. The ribs were decent, a little too fatty but that is to be expected. Mac n cheese was off the chain. Green beans were just that, nothing special. My son had green beans, mac n cheese, and homefries. He didn't care for the homefries cause they were more like sauted potatoes and he prefers fries. My husband had the shrimp po'boy and homefries. He said his was good.

Our drinks stayed empty for the most part so service needs to be better. We left an 18% tip (he's lucky he got that), and the server picked the receipt up before we left and had an ugly look on his face like we didn't leave enough. Sorry, next time you should pay more attention to your tables. They weren't that busy. There were plenty of empty tables. 

All in all, it was a nice family dinner in the city. Wasn't even too expensive (about the price you'd pay at Chili's).

We needed a quick place to eat before going to the bc music factory so stopped here being on tv food maps. The server was nice and very quick service. Not to mention was pretty cheap. I normally don't know cornbread but here it's awesome! Just a little sweetness to it. We also got the fried green tomatoes, I liked them because I prefer restaurants that use cornmeal and they did, I suggest to ask for some extra sauce they drizzle on top. If it friend chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy and Mac and cheese. Overall pretty standard soul food, to be honest it was good but wasn't the best I've ever had for all three items. The chicken was a large portion and the gravy could have used a little more flavor. Overall pretty good for a quick bite to eat.",PositivejNWsK_rWPTtnlJoaj9hwNg,"Okay. So I don't see the hoopla about this place.  We had salmon cakes, I had the pork chops, okra, and the green beans. My dish was pretty simple in taste. My friend on the hand, had the backend catfish, mac and cheese,  and the cabbage. Ideally her dish would've been my choice but I decided to live vicariously through her. The breading on the  fish had a lot of pepper, yet the fish it self was bland. The Mac and cheese was dry and obviously reheated more than once :(

Our server was pleasant,  but she annoyed the crap out of  me when not once but twice decided to inform us that ""in the south  they throw pepper over the shoulder into a dish.""

Our server just stood at the end of the table waiting to take out order but didn't speak. After we gave her our order she couldn't remember it and Asked for it again.

When my Mac and cheese and ribs came out there was barely any meat and it was definitely not a half rack like advertised.

We arrived during lunch hour on a weekday, and it was a nice day so we decided to sit outside. The place is not that big, but the restaurant is full of character inside.

I ordered Chicken Wings as an appetizer... ummm that was definitely a given! For my main course, I ordered Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes with Mac and Cheese and Green Beans as the fixins. My mom had Fried Catfish, along with Collard Greens and some other fixin I can't remember. 

So let me dish on my dishes. The Chicken Wings were delivered nice and hot, crispy but lacking in flavor. The Salmon Cakes had a decent presentation, did not have a strong fishy taste, but they were super salty, I couldn't finish more than a few bites. The macaroni and cheese... well it was mostly cheese and not much macaroni. I think they gave me the top layer. The green beans were delicious. They were well seasoned and flavorful. I left

And service was lacking as well... the server was friendly, but service was slow and it was not that busy... my water stayed empty and we waited a little too long for the check. It was like we were outside and forgotten *sad face*, so I had to ask another waitress to find our server to bring us the check.

So overall, I was super disappointed with our lunch at Mert's. We were underwhelmed and the food was overpriced. I'm from Charlotte so I know of many other places to find great soul food, so I probably won't return.

The advantage of being on the road and dining for one did mean I got seated much quicker than the people on the wait list.

This time I ordered the salmon cake with yam and slaw, which Yelpers were highly recommending.

The sweet yam was like a dessert in itself - and I love candied yam so that was big tick for me.  The slaw was finely chopped and creamy, also lived up to expectation.  The Salmon cake tho - slightly under salted.  Seeing that this is poached salmon with added flavoring after, I think maybe some of the salmon flavor got lost along the way.  Overall still tasty and solid but I would say their other items such as fried chicken and ribs were more to my liking.

Service was also  little chaotic - it was packed.  The waitress brought me my food with my cutlery, and then my ice tea never came (I forgot about it too but never saw my waitress coming by and too hungry to wait).

The food was great. I had the catfish, yams and green beans. It was a bit salty for my taste but otherwise great! The loaf of cornbread came out first and I had to stop myself from eating it like it was the meal. It was perfect. Not too sweet and not too dry.

The place was packed and the cool thing was the crowd was pretty diverse. I think you can tell a lot about a place by the crowd that eats there. This one seemed to appeal to everyone. So I would definitely go back. The service was kind of sketchy. She was fast and it was accurate we just had to ask for things that seemed standard - like refills & to go boxes. It was super busy though. All and all It's in the top 5 of soul food places I've been to across the country. The atmosphere and the music were also pretty fun. My only regret is that I didn't try the cobbler. Oh and if you're like me you will get enough food for 2 meals. Be prepared!",PositiveWaj7VfyRBmjzXarXqid55g,"Leave it to my Yelp family to send me to the best spots when I'm traveling. I came to Charlotte for a conference and decided to check Mert's out with a bunch of my colleagues. In short, we loved it!

Cornbread: I've never been a huge cornbread fan, but this cornbread had me wanting more and more! It was soooooooo hot and delicious!

Jumbo wings: You get three with the meal. Fried perfectly. Delicious. Delicious. Delicious.

Mac & Cheese: I can't seem to find decent mac & cheese out west so I wait until I come back East to get my fix. This mac & cheese was all things perfect! Two thumbs up.

Collard greens: This was my least favorite dish. While I appreciated that they weren't overlooked, they were really vinegary. I wasn't a fan.

Sweet potato cake: I had never heard of such a delicacy. I figured since I love sweet potatoes and I'm a fan of cake, this would hit the spot! I think it needed more butter though as it was really dry.

The waitress was pleasant but i felt kind of rushed when I ordered and once or food came she didn't come back until we wanted the bill. We ordered catfish which had little seasoning,  beef ribs which had flavor but were mostly fast and bones, collard greens that were more bitter than eating lemons. Let me add that I almost slipped in my heels walking in and out because the floor wad so greasy and covered with food. Oh let me not forget the salty peach cobbler that looked like someone laid a piece of bread on top for the crust. The peaches weren't even sweet. I'm sorry, someone told be I'd feel like i was eating at my grandma's kitchen.  On her worst day her cooking never tasted this bad. If i had to describe this place in one word ""Yuck"" would be it.

I ordered the catfish...it was ok; not completely done but seasoned well. Not sure if it was fried or shake n bake. The Mac n cheese tasted like it was cooked on the grill. Someone in our party ordered jumbo chicken wings and had to request that they be cooked more. A waiter took my MIL plate from the table without asking if she was done.

Isn't a place I would go out of my way to get food from and definitely not worth the hype.

Peace",PositiveMOP_Nhc0tOr6KsYlExhIiQ,"After seeing Mert's featured on the Food Network, I was super excited about visiting this place while visiting Charlotte. I arrived on a Saturday during lunch hour and was seated within 10 minutes. Our server was not friendly nor attentive the entire time but she did have a few parties in addition to my table of 2. It took about 20 minutes before we even got our drinks. By the time she was ready to take our order, we decided to put our entire order in all at the same time so our entrees came well before our appetizers. Once we were ready to go, it took about 15 minutes for our check to be delivered. I know the place was busy but they really need to improve on their customer service. 

Now for the take on food. Let me preference that I'm from the South and grew up eating and cooking Soul/Southern food my entire life so I may be a little bias.

Appetizers
We ordered the Soul Rolls which were amazing. Black eyed peas, collard greens, chicken and rice egg roll style. They are unique and very tasty.  They also give you complementary cornbread which is pretty good. I think they must use sour cream with the mix because it had a more tangy flavor.  

Entrees
My boyfriend ordered Shrimp and Grits. He enjoyed the dish but definitely has had better. The Roux was very bland and the grits were a little overcooked.  I ordered the Fried catfish plate with macaroni & cheese and collard greens. My catfish was good but both my sides lacked flavor. The macaroni & cheese tasted like off brand cheese mixed with heavy butter.  My collard greens was way too salty. I've had better greens from a can of Glory.

Overall - I think a must try is the Soul Rolls for sure. All the other food seems very commercial and lacks flavor. And you must be willing to overlook the horrible service as well.",NegativeDwBJl5o8-dTB0CWjjkkSgw,"Well smack the dentures right out of your southern grandma's mouth! Just like a old time Sunday dinner in the Deep South! As your ears are filled with music of the soul, R&B, and blues varieties; once your server sets the plate of cornbread loafs on your table, you know you're in for a treat! Yes, cornbread loafs that are sweet and when smothered with the accompanying butter, absolutely delicious! We ordered the salmon patties with Mac n Cheese and green beans! This is not salmon from a can, instead fresh poached salmon that are extremely tasty! The Mac n Cheese was probably baked before serving, and without question the best I've had at a restaurant! The green beans were cooked, no doubt, in some kind of bacon grease presumably. We also had a combination plate of the bbq beef ribs with a fried chicken breast! I'm not a fan of beef ribs, but these were tender and not overpowered by the bbq sauce! The fried chicken was, well, southern fried chicken at its finest! We also tried the candied yams which were cooked perfectly without being too sweet from the brown sugar. The place makes you feel as though your in a diner in Harlem; with the decor and old time soul music blending with the aromas of fresh southern roots! The servers could be a little more attentive, however our redeemed himself after seeing us stop another waitress to ask for refills. I will say that each employee was personable, hospitable, and eager when asked to give you their take on the food and history of this popular spot in downtown Charlotte.

Food = The salmon cakes and soul rolls were very good.  I would definitely recommend those two appetizers,  as appetizers or as your main dish.  The fried whitening fish was very good.  The fried chicken was just okay.  I have had a lot of fried chicken I would recommend over theirs.  The cabbage and yam sides were good as well.  The only thing I will skip next time is the fried chicken.

My family traveled 6 hours from Washington, D.C. To Charlotte yesterday to help a friend move and heard great things about Mert's. When we arrived we were asked to wait outside while our table was being prepared. There were 13 of us so that wasn't a surprise but the place was only half full so it seemed unnecessary. ONE HOUR LATER we checked back with the hostess who hadnt BEGUN to prepare our table because she was busy with her friends and what appeared to be her newborn baby. We were seated and enjoyed our waiter. The food was another story. My husband ordered shrimp creole and I got the fried catfish and fried leg quarter with seasoned rice and Mac and cheese. I will say that the fried catfish was smaller than expected yet delicious but I felt that EVERYTHING ELSE was terrible. The rice was well over cooked and tasted like the bottom on the pan was scraped to get rid of it and my Mac and cheese was burned. The shrimp creole tasted like shrimp covered with tomato sauce on top of the same old dry rice. Overall I really wanted my experience to be as good as others have told me but even my sister in law who recommended the place was surprised at how bad her food was.

So after waiting patiently, we were then asked to wait "" outside"". She didn't ask any of the people that came after us, but saw fit to approach the next ones to be seated.

As far as I'm concerned, it's the only one I would truly ever need! I come from a family of Southerners who are absolute connoisseurs of cornbread. My parents agree that Mert's fresh, hot cornbread slathered with a pat of butter is the best they've ever tasted. (Sorry to my great-grandpa who owned a Southern diner outside Knoxville, TN, whose cornbread recipe has been passed down the generations of my family ever since - it's a close second.) Their Soul Rolls are divine, but with the cornbread and generous portions, an appetizer isn't really needed. I have had the fried chicken (excellent), the beef short ribs (delicious), and the fried catfish (fantastic), but the meal that in my mind has been handed down straight from heaven is the salmon cakes. Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes are served with their homemade remoulade sauce and give you a glimpse into heaven that you will want to savor slowly. My go-to side items are the collard greens, topped with tomato and onion, and the mac and cheese. I went to Mert's after the most recent half-marathon I completed, devoured my delicious meal and polished it off with a giant slice of their sweet potato cake. It sounded too interesting to pass up. And, when else could I have justified all those delicious calories? I have only had one ""hit or miss"" visit to Mert's, where the cornbread was a bit toastier than I prefer, but everything was still fantastic.

The sweet tea and amazing cornbread recipes could only come from someone fortunate enough to be born in the south-would of made my grandmother proud.

The mac n cheese was a little dry but the taste was spot on. The meal was not terrible, but I was disappointed. At one point a representative approached our table and asked if we were the patrons who had a problem with the fish. We were not, but that means someone else didn't enjoy their dinner either.

Merts popped up on my radar after looking for a lunch spot open on a Sunday. Given that yelp only rated this place as a 3.5 stars, I was hesitant on going, but I really wanted to venture out and fill my stomach with Southern cuisine.

I purposely went early to avoid the lunchtime crowds and there was more than enough seats available. I debated between the fried chicken and shrimp dishes the night prior and settled on the shrimp Creole since there were mixed ratings on the chicken. However, when I told nut waitress that I have never tried grits before, she highly suggested that I try their shrimp and grits. And with that, my order for shrimp and grits went through. My waitress appeared within minutes with their famous cornbread. I am not really a fan of the dry, crumbly texture of cornbread on general, but this cornbread was moist and bursting of flavor. I now knew what was so great about their cornbread.

After several minutes, my order of shrimp and grits arrived. I wasnt expecting much given that grits do not have the greatest reputation--I heard they are bland, mealy, and literally gritty in texture. With a spoonful of brown gravy, shrimp, tomatoes, onions, and grits, I had a taste. This was Southern comfort food at its finest--the type that transports you to another era...back to the kitchen you grew up in. Granted, I'm not from the South but I could tell that this dish was made with soul. The buttery, creamy grits with the flavorful gravy and crunch of the onions. The shrimp were large and plump and well paired with the gravy. The focaccia bread was also great in soaking up the gravy.

For allb those looking for comfort food, try the shrimp and grits.

First time here. I was in town for a conference and me and my friends just did Crossfit so I asked the concierge at my hotel to direct me to a place where I can get my grub on... 

He asks like chicken and stuff? I said like Mac and cheese and ribs and all that Good stuff lol and this is where it brought me.

It's a small southern comfort food style place. My expectations ran high as I saw Guy Fieri ""was here"". Plus who could go wrong with comfort food right?

The restaurant hours didn't close till about half an hour after we walked in.

And one of the waiters didn't want to sit us in his area because he didn't want to serve any more tables on his side. Well thanks Pal. The restaurant really isn't that big.

Anywhooooo...

We ordered and our waitress was kind of snappy. I guess she was overwhelmed and tired that day that she wanted to close the restaurant already. 

I wanted to order the ribs with Mac and cheese and string bean. But the waitress informed us there wasn't anymore. Okay... How about the corn on the cob? We're out of that too. 

As I grew frustrated and hungry, I just opted out totally off the second side dish. Out of everything , I was looking forward to the Mac and cheese more than anything.

Our cornbread came right away, served nice and warm. delicious! But our entrees took a while.

Then a miracle happened! The kitchen staff was so kind enough to make a batch of fresh Mac and cheese. Praise the Lord!

And purely because of that reason, I gave them one extra star for that really kind gesture.

Our food came and it really was a mouthful. My ribs was DROWNED in sauce and oil. Tasted good like any other ribs to me. Mac and cheese was great. String bean was really soggy . I don't know if it should look like that on purpose.

First thought was wow this place is tiny. The ambience is casual and the staff there are really friendly. 

My favorite part the food. They bring out individual cornbread loaf's with a honey butter after you place your order. I must say it was great I ate mines and half of my mother's. I honestly would go just for the cornbread. Then we got the rest of our meals I ordered a chicken wing plate with red beans and rice with gravey. The chicken was flavorless tasted like flour.

The customer service is lacking horribly, service is sllooowww, chicken has been under-cooked two times now out of our 3 recent visits, and the list goes on. All these downs have swayed us away from Mert's now unfortunately. Every time we want to grab something soulful to eat, we think of Mert's....then remember what has happened the last three consecutive times....and then we back out and chose elsewhere. Truly unfortunate, but I would rather not risk spending $30+ to have uncooked food or feel as though we do not even exist in a restaurant that should be serving us, taking our orders, refilling our drinks without us wondering around to find someone to do so :( Really hoping for the best and that the management there straightens up and get this place in shape again.",NegativewgLvuwGkm8G4Sl0PUdEOEA,"This place was a huge disappointment- unfortunately.  Made a special trip downtown to eat here after picking up a friend from the airport before heading out on the road.  First of all, this location is downtown- very limited parking- so be prepared to pay to park unless you get lucky and get an actual available street spot- very unlikely though.  We found parking in a garage and had to pay $8....umm, not cool!  Upon arriving at the restaurant- it was very slow- but it was around 3 pm.  The ambiance was good and our server was polite and semi-attentive.  
The cornbread is great; yet they are pretty stingy with the butter....so be prepared to request more or use sparingly especially if sharing.  I ordered the fried catfish along with yams & Mac n' cheese.  The catfish tasted really muddy/dirty - such a disappointment because it had a great batter on it- but I had to drown it in their unimpressive  and tasteless tartar sauce and some siracha ketchup just to drown out the dirt taste.....the yams were so-so and the Mac n' cheese wasn't very memorable.  The other person in my party ordered the vegetable plate....again yams, Mac n' cheese, and potato salad....her comments matched mine in the similar dishes and as for the potato salad- her comments were that it was just ok.   She got a garden Salad and it was the smallest-saddest little garden salad.  I suppose that maybe since this restaurant was featured in triple ""D"" - then we had high expectations....just wasn't blown away by our meal and there was nothing to crave to make me want to come back.  So disappointed.....",NegativeUeQZ2A2jGEtvm2JUKDWqQg,"I have no idea how this place has so many good reviews. Maybe we went on an off night or something but there wasn't anything left ( no fish, no salmon cakes, no Mac & cheese, no mashed potatoes, etc.) and the chick failed to mention that until we were actually trying to order our food. They only had  chicken, pork chops, ribs and greens left for the most part. The chicken looked like it was good, I ordered the pork chop and that thing was cooked beyond repair. I felt like I was chewing meat flavored rubberbands. My fiance had ribs that were mostly fat and gristle. The greens were under seasoned and undercooked (and why were they garnished with raw tomatoes??). I mean, we went in there with such high hopes and were so disappointed. I'm gonna just assume that we came on an off night and I may give it another try cause I wanna try those salmon cakes everyone raves about, but I'm skeptical.

This place did not knock my socks off.  The food was ok.  It wasn't the most amazing seasoning, but everything was cooked correctly.  The corn muffins were huge and came out hot, but didn't have that gritty corn texture that I hate about corn muffins.  I don't know what they do to those tasty treats, but it beats bringing out a bread basked any day.  The downside was that they did not have any of the ""specials"" listed on the chalk board above the kitchen.  Mert's...you can't put broccoli & cheese up there and expect me to be like ""oh yeah, I didn't want that anyway even though it's been staring me in the face for the last 15 minutes.""

The server was really nice. I'm also not sure if the Manager was also helping out, but he was certainly on the floor taking care of business.

The decor seemed like a bit of a mish mosh.  It wasn't a dirty place, but it definitely seemed a bit outdated and pieced together.

The service was good. We were a party of 10 and had two wait staff on a Friday night. There was no wait for a table. The atmosphere is very nostalgic and I loved the music. We stayed longer because of it. I ordered the chicken wings with cabbage and collards. It also came with cornbread; one of my favorite. The cabbage was a hit at the table. I liked the collards even though they did not taste like mine. That had a hint of vinegar and they were topped with chopped onions and tomatoes. They we slightly al dente but that was fine too since they had a good flavor. The meal came with three large whole wings that were seasoned and fried to perfection. Now for the cornbread. I happen to be an expert at this and I know each person has their preference. It was a mini loaf and slightly over cooked. The top should be light brown with no Blackmon the edges. It was more dense than cakey which is okay for me but it lacked flavor. Slightly sweet which is okay too. My issue was that it did not come hot. They whipped butter just sat on it when I cut it open.

Now that I've gotten that out of my system......

I love soul food!  I don't eat it often, but when I do I want it to feel like Sunday dinner.  Mert's did that for me.  I ordered the beef ribs and was a little disappointed, but that's what happens when you live in the BBQ capital of the world for about 8 years (TX).  Aside from that, the sides were just as good as it gets.  I love that they cook their greens with vinegar which is such a southern thing.  I threw a couple of drops of Texas Pete on there and my taste buds were in heaven.  Their famous salmon cakes were a bit dry for my taste.  Maybe I caught a bad batch, but I'd like to believe that they can be waaay more tender and moist.

The wait staff were so funny and friendly.  I felt completely at home.  I'm hoping they expand soon because seating does get tight!  We were seated by the exit door and on a 30 something degree night it literally takes the warmth away from the atmosphere and my food, lol!

We were seated quickly, and offered the choice between inside, inside upstairs where the live jazz was playing, or outside. (We went with outside, why not?)

Our waiter was attentive without being over bearing, and our drinks refilled without having to ask. He explained not only the specials but the ""house favorites"" as well.  We both chose something off the regular menu, wanting to see standards rather than one offs for our 1st visit, and we were not disappointed at all! We both enjoyed food that had flavor, and character, and didn't taste like everything else. I suppose coming from NY, we we're a bit spoiled by the variety and quantity of food choices, and it was nice to see with a little bit of poking around, it can still be found in our new home.

The typical Nola food didn't fair as well.  The gumbo was heavy on the tomato, and poorly seasoned, and the red beans and rice was virtually flavor-free.  I enjoyed eating here, but I wouldn't return for cajun food (I would return for the fried food, it was delish).

There are very few things I find myself yearning for, but the Crawfish Etouffe at the Cajun Queen s definitely one of them.  The crawfish are so succulent, and chewy, and they give you so many, that you can't help but chew on two or three in each mouthwatering bite.  I think the deliciousness is a combination of the crawfish, and this amazing rich buttery,  sauce they cover the crawfish and rice in.  Really Really good.  I also really like their fried oysters, they were fried perfectly and each oyster was big and meaty, and they gave me a ton of oysters with my order, so I was a very happy man.  Yeah baby Fried oysters and plenty of 'em, that's what I'm talking about.  The restaurant can get a little crowded on weekends, but seven  nights  a week they  do have live jazz upstairs.

I usually go for the red beans and rice and the fried green tomatoes appetizer, as there's not a lot in the way of veggie-friendly food...but I'm ok with what I get, as it's really, really good.

The server was very prompt and made sure that we received our orders quick enough so that we could make it to our show with plenty of time.

I was apprehensive at first because of the cuisine type, not a fan of spicy foods, however, the menu has got variety for every taste: seafood, steaks, pasta, grains, potatoes, soups, salads and even the fried green tomato. No kidding. It was actually pretty good, reminded me of fried eggplant. Unusual.

Portions are humongous! I don't usually leave food on my plate, however, here, it was just humanly impossible for me to finish the buttery blackened chicken over Aveoulle pasta. 

Solid four stars for bringing New Orleans to Charlotte.

Made a reservation arrived early and was seated after waiting 30 minutes after the reservation had passed. We came for the Jazz but wound up sitting in a room with no band and canned music.

The food was ok - and if we'd been seated earlier and able to actually hear the music I would give this place a 4 star review.",ObjectiveRb1-N_lmVcGKBnc_kVNGew,"I went last Friday to celebrate my 5 year wedding anniversary. Our 2 year old daughter was with us as well. The place was alot busier than I was expecting. It was such an exciting atmosphere. We loved it! My daughter said to us ""wow, were at a party"". The music band plays upstairs and that is where we were seated. We had a short wait around 10 minutes and the manager seated us right in front of the band as if he read my mind. That is exactly where we wanted to sit. I'm not a fan of spicy food and the waiter recommended instead of blackened, I can order the fish or chicken to be grilled and it was amazing. The popcorn crawfish was excellent. Beers were $3, $4 The whole experience was great, fun and we spent only $80 including the tip. I had spent more than double that at Villa Antonio a few months back for my wife's 30th bday and did not have as nice of a time. I would definitely go back and recommend to anyone wanting to have more than just your average dinner at applebees :)",PositiveJL1PLy0ppP5xh5jphpRsgA,"I LOVE this restaurant. So far, I have only been twice, but boy I wish I could afford to go weekly! My boyfriend and I just went for Valentine's Day. Had a reservation, got there a little early, and were still seated immediately, and in the jazz room too! (Side note: the female singer they had on Valentine's was INCREDIBLE. Wish I got her name) My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE the rolls they give everyone, possibly the best rolls I've had at any restaurant. For my drink, I ordered the chocolate martini, my favorite! Oh, and of course a Hurricane later, also delicious

For my entree I had the special Tilapia with the crawfish topping. OH! First, let me mention, the gumbo that comes before the entree is AMAZING. I don't care if it's not authentic! Who cares about authenticity when the food is THAT good. I ate that gumbo so fast my boyfriend was making comments like, ""Slow down, it's not going anywhere!"" It had a little bit of a kick to it, which I don't normally like, but the flavor was just too good! Now, back to the entree. Last time, I ordered the same thing, but I didn't even try the crawfish topping; I just gave it all to my mom. This time, however, I realized what a mistake that was! I've actually never had crawfish before, so I have nothing to compare theirs to, but it was delicious, and I'm already craving more! The tilapia, like the first time, was also to-die-for. I will admit I'm biased because I like tilapia pretty much anywhere I go as long as they cook it right, but my boyfriend seemed to like it as well. He also loved his salmon special with the shrimp topping (as did I!).

Unfortunately, neither of us were able to leave room for dessert, so I have nothing to say about that. Overall, this place is definitely in my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte now. The only problem is the parking, which is almost unavoidable whenever you go there. It's such a tiny place with barely any parking, but I'd rather deal with the parking than have them move to another location. The tiny old building, along with the jazz music playing, makes me feel like I've gone back in time. It's such a cozy, romantic restaurant. Definitely a great choice for Valentine's Day, and even my extremely picky, high-maintenance boyfriend (I love him, but he is!) agreed. Believe me, he wasn't lying. He wouldn't hesitate to tell me if I picked a bad restaurant! lol.",PositiveXCF-nQZXnU0WS71RSvMDeA,"I really enjoyed this restaurant.  The Jazz was fantastic!

Mediocre wine by the glass and only four rubbery shrimp (although the sauce was great--but we had to ask for bread after they brought the dish )in the $9 BBQ shrimp appetizer.  Finally seated in the room with music (which we requested and they honored) and the music was very average and too loud. We asked for water with no ice and the waiter actually rolled his eyes at us.  5 minutes later the waitress came and asked what we wanted with her order pad out, and we said, ""menus"". She finally brought some for us and the table next to us and left.  Another waitress came by and we asked if there was any way to turn the air-conditioning down since it was blowing directly on us, and she walked away without saying anything. First waitress came back and took the order of the table next to us which was seated after us and walked away without taking our order.  We had to call someone over to say we wanted to order.  They found our waitress and conveyed our request to her, and we saw her roll her eyes too.

Now, I like my food to have a KICK but this was, what I would call, a controlled KICK.  Just enough spice to get the tongue and mouth salivating and begging for more.  You could always add some more Louisiana hot sauce if you wanted.  Then, to top it off.... bread pudding.. Oh Lordy Lord Lord, the bread pudding.. SOOOOOooo good.  I would go back just for the bread pudding.  

Atmosphere/Staff:  
Bo, the bartender made a mean Hurricane and had extensive knowledge of the shrimp apps that proved to be very helpful.  Everything about the two story restaurant was uniquely decorated and made you feel comfortable and relaxed.  The upstairs outdoor patio was quaint and cozy with a classy touch.

I had a Creole sauce mixed with a TON of veggies and served with rice on the side.

The atmosphere is what sells me on the Cajun Queen, an intimate setting that is laid out in a big house. Upstairs has jazz music, while downstairs has a bunch of little tables for small parties.

We'll definitely be back. A+",PositiverxrsOLcq-6pwNNb7W6isZQ,"Elizabeth is one of my favorite parts of town; I love how old houses have been remade into restaurants and offices.  Too often charming old buildings are paved over and replaces with concrete boxes.  The Cajun Queen is in one of these old homes, and this lends it a very intimate and warm atmosphere.

Of course, atmosphere isn't everything when it comes to restaurants, but the food at the Cajun Queen was fortunately spot-on as well.  Our tables started with the fried oyster appetizer, and it was a hit: emarkably light for a fried dish, it was like eating little oyster clouds.  For my main course, I ordered etouffee with all three (chicken, shrimp, and crawfish).  It was creamy and deeply, darkly spicy.  I was a little worried about the protein aspect, since those three items have different cooking times, but all were perfectly done.

The Cajun Queen provided us with a delicious dinner.  I knock a single star off only because the service, while not bad, wasn't great either.  The place isn't exactly cheap, so our waiter earned a nice tip.  He could've paid just slightly more attention to our table.  Oh well, everyone has an off day.",Positiveuo0iusHhI5XcQ689AAEgfg,"Awesome etouffee.  It actually isn't as spicy as I thought it'd be.  I got the shrimp, chicken, and crawfish combo.

The bar was packed and had only one bartender, so it was also very slow.

The drinks are outstanding too!",Positiveq0i2NBnuqq_6fXQeGn8-LQ,"I've been to Cajun Queen a couple times, once for a work meeting and once on a date with my boyfriend. The meeting was definitely the better experience solely in terms of food, everything was spot on and delicious - I especially loved the crawfish scampi! For my entree I went with tilapia which tasted very good. 

The last time we went service was slow (it was a weekday), and the food surprisingly forgettable. We split the calamari appetizer which was pretty standard and each had the steak Diane. I am a rare girl but found the meat a bit tough- usually filet should be easy to cut through, this wasn't the case.

Me and Mine went here a few weeks ago for Brunch. 
She had the shrimp & grits
I had had the gumbo.. Everything was nice and neat, served hot (We were the 1st there so no wait)

It was close to 12noon, we had finished our food and basically waiting for the clock to strike 12 so we could order a cocktail before leaving. Well it was was sooooooo close, (maybe 5mins or so) that the waiter placed our order. 

I asked about the bloody marry (Muddy Waters), never really had one (Bloody Mary). The waiter asked.. ARE YOU SURE (with a devilish grin).... (see picture). Well after a 20 bet.. I reluctantly pulled the oyster out only to find it looks like some bull nuts (sorry for the graphic) But thats what made the bet worth wild. 

Trust and Believe, I have video of me taking the ""shot"" (its really too much drink and biggggg oyster to be a shot).

Everything went well, the waiter found it hill-arry-us.

Cheer's",PositiveT9KjYGGpohE0WgNOz0xdCA,"Wow, I can't believe that I haven't written a review of the Cajun Queen before!  I guess because it is such a ""Charlotte Institution"" that I just imagined I would have written about it before!  Anyhow, this is one of my fav places to go when we actually leave the ""Ballantyne Bubble"".  

We recently purchased a Groupon and went to meet some friends there for dinner.  While I love saving the $$ associated with groupon-type specials, I really dread going to the restaurant when I know that they are going to be swamped with other customers who are also taking advantage of the savings.  It seems that most restaurants do not properly prepare for the increase in business that will result from offering the coupons.  Many times, we have noticed that there is not enough staff to handle the increased number of customers -- so the level of service and also the quality of the food suffers. But enough of that tangent...back to the Cajun Queen...

Since there were going to be 6 of us, we made a reservation.  David and I arrived before the rest of our party, so we went upstairs to the bar while we waited. The bar was pretty full and I must say, the service in the bar area suffered because of it. It took a while to get our beers and the bartender didn't bother offering an orange or a glass for my Blue Moon, which was disappointing. But I had my ""big girl panties"" on , so I got over it and just decided to try and enjoy the beer straight from the bottle sans l'orange.  

Almost immediately after getting our beers, the hostess announced over the loudspeaker that our party of 6 was being seated.  Yay, CQ for having our table ready on time!  And yay friends for not being late! :0

After being seated in a nice big corner table, we decided to order 3 appetizers for the table to share and went with the bar-b-cue shrimp, some sort of fried crawfish thing, and fried pickles. The bbq shrimp was definitely my fav of the 3.  I personally can live without fried pickles, but the other folks in our party seemed to really like them.  I am not normally a huge fan of crawfish, but this dish was really tasty.   Sadly, there were no oysters available for appetizers (although the waiter said they had a few in reserve for one of the entrees).  

For my entree, I went with the shrimp etouffee - one of my favorite dishes.  It was spot on!  David had the shrimp creole and I tasted a bite of it - it was very good as well but not as spicy as mine. (I like spicy!)   We ordered some desserts to share among the table and for some reason, ended up with 2 pieces of key lime pie and 1 of the tollhouse cookie something-or-another.  They were both good, but I wish someone at the table had ordered a bread pudding because theirs is delish! 

This would have been a 5 star review, except for the fact that there were several issues with the service thorughout our meal.  Nothing egregious, but a series of little things (mostly a lack of attention to detail) that detracted from making this a 5 star experience.  

But, all-in-all, we had a great time and everyone enjoyed their meal.

Would definitely recommend this place for a Nawlins meal in a fun, warm setting.",PositiveWSrJNSJnz7tmWnFYr8DdzA,"We started off with what everyone suggested, yes the Fried Green Tomatoes and the Cajun Popcorn (Fried Crawfish). It was awesome. The green tomatoes were not sour and it came with a sauce that made it tangy. This sauce also came with the fried crawfish and it complemented with it well.

I ordered the Diane with all three (chicken, shrimp, and crawfish) my mother ordered the chicken, my father ordered the pork chop, and my brother followed with everyone's recommendation of the BBQ shrimp.

The Diane: absolutely to die for. It wasn't extremely spicy, the spice and kick came from the use of pepper and maybe a dash of cayenne pepper. But it was creamy, and with the mushrooms, chicken, crawfish, and shrimp it was amazing. I have to personally say that this was probably the best dish, or tied with the pork chop at least.

The chicken was probably the worse of the 4 dishes there, but on the bright side we did order the 3 good dishes. Next, the Pork Chop:
This was awesome as well. The flavor was just off the chain! It wasn't spicy, but that sauce they added to the pork chop had a tangy flavor and then it was sweet as well. The meat was also well cooked, juices just coming out of it. Delicious.

The last dish BBQ Shrimp:
If you're a spicy dish lover, this is the dish you should get. My father as well as brother found it pretty spicy (I did too), but whoa. The flavor on the shrimp as well as the rice was absolutely delicious (before the kick of the spiciness of course). It had a tangy sweet taste to it at first, then it just kicks back. 

Parking was kinda crappy, but it goes well with the environment and ambiance of the restaurant. A house/restaurant gives it a homey feel, as well as a high class dining experience. But, parking and getting out of that parking lot is a pain. *Note, there is an exit/entrance at the back of the parking lot as well as the front to 7th street.* (But I would recommend to enter from 7th street)

We started off with the BBQ Shrimp, which had decent-sized shrimpies swimming around in cajun tastiness and it was just enough to leave us wanting more. I had the 4-way etouffee, yes, 4-WAY ettouffee with chicken, shrimp, crawfish and sausage and it was just what the doctor ordered for my spice addiction! My man ordered the shrimp and grits and loved his so much that he ate it again at home the next night! The etouffee was obviously meaty and spicy, while the shrimp and grits were creamy and plentiful. I, of course, enjoyed my meal with a Dixie's Blackened Voodoo (spiced) lager. Spice, spice, spice!

Bonus while dining at Cajun Queen: LIVE jazz music every night of the week! If you sit  upstairs, you will have the pleasure of  eating and drinking to fun music that totally fits the Cajun cuisine. The band may be a little too loud at times to have a normal dinner conversation but this is what makes the experience fun! If you would rather a more quiet dinner, make a reservation for the downstairs area of the restaurant or for a table outside. 

Just a heads up: You may have to wait a few minutes before your table is ready for your reservation...  All the more reason to belly up to the bar while you wait. Duh.

The restaurant is an old house in a very nice area of town an area called Elizabeth. Open every night for dinner, and they have a Live Jazz band every night.
Tried the Abita Beers (Amber, and Fruity) both good. In the second floor of the house is the bar, and in a room next to it is the Jazz Band. Nice art in the walls that is for sale without price meaning - if you have to ask you can not afford it. For appetizers we tried the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp (4.5) - the right amount of spiciness, with layers of flavor. You will want to use the bread to soak all that wonderful juiciness. We also ordered the Craw-fish Scampi (3), it was lemony and not as complex as the shrimp. The Blackened new York steak was nice but uneventful (3)  the Mahi-Mahi with Diane sauce on top of mashed potatoes (4)was very good. I tried the special of the day - Pan Seared Duck Breast ( medium) on top of garlic fried potatoes w Craw-fish Etouffe (4.5) really nice combination. It had the best flavors of Cajun/Creole cuisine but it was not spicy or heavy. The only weak note was the Seafood Gumbo (2.5) it was just OK a bit bland, I added some drops of the hot sauce and it was better.  In conclusion, it was a very nice experience and definitely a high end New Orleans experience.  They do not offer espresso =(. But the Bourbon Bread Pudding hit a perfect mark, it was unexpected light and fluffy, not too sweet. We also had a very good Pecan Pie (3.5).",PositivedF8lp-7PxkzOUNsmqij0UQ,"Had a great dinner here last night in part because of the great deal we got from groupon and the fact that they have a good selection of Abita beers.  

The shrimp touffe and shrimp diane that we got were both quite good, and the service was pretty decent as well.  They forgot a few things, but were nice people at least.   The location is pretty nice and we were able to take a walk around the block afterwards to help digest (why the hell is 7th street totally paved over into some 5 lane highway... slow down people).

Having just gone to New Orleans a few months ago, I'm glad that Charlotte has a place to get  this type of food, although it's still not perfectly on point.

Live Jazz never hurts (but if you sit downstairs you won't be able to see it and probably can't hear it too well either).",PositiveN3THFatXrRyx9dWmmJSEew,"We went to the Cajun Queen for Sunday brunch. We had an 11:00 reservation so we were the first ones in the restaurant. We were greeted by our hostess and two servers who were smiling, friendly, and ready to go. 
We ordered the beignets with homemade strawberry jam for starters, warm, light, sprinkled with powdered sugar, yummy! 
We had the tasso biscuits and gravy, an omelet, the crab cake eggs benedict, and chicken strips with French fries from the kids menu.  Everything was great including the service and unsweetened iced tea.  The serving size was large, but not excessive.  When we were finished, we were too full to try the Key Lime pie which we were told was to die for. 
If I had any complaint, it would be that the tables are a little too small for the generously sized plates, but this is a small place, so the small tables are a necessary requirement. The jazz music is a little loud, but not obnoxious, and is appropriate for the New Orleans Cajun and creole menu. 
All in all, a very pleasant experience. We will be going back for dinner to try the regular entrees.",Positive7bGWkWVtIaG0x9wSFhQgHQ,"MY man and i scooped up not one but 2 groupons to this place and used the second one up last night.  Will we be back for another meal at full price you ask?  Absofreakinlutely!  We have always had attentive servers and fast service.  I'm a fan of the gumbo...could be a little spicier...but I'm kind of crazy in the heat department.  I had the blackened pork dish which comes with fresh pineapple, fried plantains,  and some kind of creamy bean sauce.  YUM...lick the plate good kind of yum.  and the bf had the blackened catfish with two heaping sides of fresh veggies.  It looked delicious and he finished the whole thing.  He has a pretty fancy palette and he loved it.  Didn't offer me a bite, but neither did I, I guess that's a good sign (we're selfish eaters).  Looks like we gotta check out the brunch next...ta!",PositiveZ7NYtoEuWAWkX_rLIT-ttw,"I had a great dinner here tonight! My party dined on the fried pickle chips, the chicken touffe, the chicken creole, the bourbon pecan pie, and the oreo cookie cheesecake. Oh we also had the Peach Aloha and Hurricane to drink. Everything was great! We cleaned all of our plates and enjoyed the atmosphere. The set up was nice, albeit a tad cramped upstairs. At times it was a little hard to talk amongst ourselves with the band playing, but this was not a deal breaker because the band took plenty of breaks so that everyone could eat, talk, and relax in peace. I can't wait to go back!",PositivebLjpOK1NqvaKENsjc7TMcg,"So earlier this year I bought a coupon off of Google Offers for Cajun Queen. I had never been here and wanted to try it so $15 for $40 worth of food was a great incentive. It took me until last week to give it a try. 

The atmosphere was dark and a bit drab. The art on the walls was nice but I was here for food. The menu was concise but could have been a bit more extensive. The prices were on the high side of expensive. Thank goodness for the coupon. 

Service was prompt but about as drab as the atmosphere. I could have used a smile from someone but it didn't come. The portions that came with my meal were just the way I like them. Not too much but enough for a good dinner. The flavor of the oysters and shrimp was above satisfactory. 

All in all, the trip was worth it, but with the coupon. I would have kicked myself if I had to pay full price for the experience received. That being said, I doubt I will be returning on my own accord.",NegativeseK77oow12GZ5xpvP-889Q,"I enjoy Cajun/Creole food as a change of pace and Cajun Queen has always delivered a good enough version of things to keep me happy.  Absolutely adore the BBQ shrimp with the only problem being the ""gravy"" is so good that I end up eating too much bread cause I can't stop sopping it up!

The gumbo is good though on my most recent visit it could have used a bit more salt.  Same for one of the specials we ordered which was blackened mahi with a crawfish, artichoke, tomato sauce.  It was flavorful with perfectly cooked fish and very lemony artichokes though.  Also got the Etouffee (secret... you can order it 4 way where they add andouille to it to go along with the 3 way version with shrimp, crawfish and chicken).  It was really good with a perfect dark roux and just enough spice to get my forehead sweating.  The shrimp in it could be better/bigger/fresher but that's a minor thing compared to the whole of the dish.

I've had the New Orleans's seafood platter before and it's deep fried goodness to be sure.  No matter what you get, portion sizes are more than adequate.

Overall this place is not New Orleans's good, if it were, it would be getting 5 stars but it's definitely good enough for me to make it a semi-regular stop when craving those flavors.",Positivem1UbbymQuOyasPcLjv0SsQ,"I'm not from New Orleans, and I have no idea what good Cajun food is supposed to taste like. Having said that, what I do know is the difference between Bad food, So-so food, and Good food.. and the food at Cajun Queen is definitely in the Good food category. I was there over the weekend, and got to try the BBQ shrimp, seafood gumbo (appetizers) and the touffe (entree). Yes, we got a little greedy and tried the touffe not just with chicken or shrimp or crawfish, but with all three! Every dish was so full of flavor and spice - not the 'my mouth is on fire' kinda spice, but the kind that is enjoyable and goes perfectly with their sweet fruit punch rum cocktail - the hurricane. I could taste the heat in the food, and the basic, yet strong flavors of salt and black pepper, paprika,  herbs and onions, and if that's what Cajun/Creole food is supposed to taste like, I need to get down to New Orleans and indulge in some more of this amazing food! In addition to the food, the service was great and quick. The restaurant was packed, but we never found ourselves sitting around looking for our waiter. He was also kind enough to replace my cocktail when I wasn't pleased with my initial choice (I ordered a Cajun martini, and now I know that that's obviously not the kind of drink you want with spicy food :) )",PositiveVyi5hALMkDRoWy3nU73B6Q,"I was quite excited to finally come here after purchasing the Google Offer, and overall, I think I got my $15 dollar's worth. The appetizer (crawfish scampi) was tiny, but delicious. The fried shrimp was very nicely done -- not battered to death. Shrimp ""Diane"" looked yummy, with plenty of onion and mushrooms. My entree, Crawfish Etouffee, was really good (though I should have tried it with some of the spices on the table), but later on, didn't quite agree with my stomach. I don't typically eat shellfish, so that is most likely the reason. I would have tried one of the fish entrees, but they're pricey. Our server Bob was okay, but kind of standoffish sometimes.

The most disappointing part was that NONE of the seafood is domestic. Bob was amused that I asked, but considering seafood is their speciality, you would think they'd take sustainability and safety seriously. http://www.montereybayaquarium.org//cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?gid=18",ObjectiveigpvO-cDPxrzfTw4IV7Byg,"I've been to New Orleans many times and have experienced some great Cajun style food, so I have pretty high standards.  For the most part, from what I've ordered, CQ does a decent job.  I've been twice and ordered the touffe both times because it's very good.  It's got the perfect amount of spice that pairs well with an ice cold Abita.  The BBQ shrimp is a great app as well.  It's not so much about the shrimp as it is the sauce you dip the bread in.  Delicious.  My girlfriend was hit and miss with her entrees in the 2 times we've been.  The shrimp Diane was just OK.  It's a lighter consistency than the touffe and doesn't have the kick I look for when I'm in the mood for Cajun.  The shrimp and grits weren't good at all.  The grits were bland and the blackened shrimp didn't hit the mark.

Overall, I enjoy coming here, but the prices are a little high.  I've had better quality for cheaper in New Orleans, but I guess you're paying the convenience fee.  Groupon & Living Social FTW!!!",ObjectivegpidKrq65_0798Y0eJiJNw,"I have been to this place plenty of times. I have always had good meals and service. But tonight was bad. I went ther with my wife's work friends. We sat at the bar tables and had a bartender named Bo(very red hair)   We had About 8 people and he insisted that if we sit at the tables we have to order food, which we had planned to do. He seemed annoyed with us because we just ordered fried oysters and lots of drinks(it was Friday and happy hour, so we were sitting around chatting and drinking)  we were actually going to order an entre and stay for dinner but Bo seemed very disinterested in us, until it came time to pay the bill, then he was really nice(tip time! Overall the food is good there, but Bo did not make it a pleasant experience. Smile Bo, it will get you far in life!",NegativeIeo4wvBq3Vkl8R8gfzbBVw,What a pleasant surprise!! The fried oysters are the best ever and so is the Diane! I had it with the crawfish and shrimp. Even the garden salad was good to be pretty simple! Definitely a great value! My family and I will be returning:),Positive
